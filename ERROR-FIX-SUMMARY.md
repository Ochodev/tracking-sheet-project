# 🔧 ERROR FIX SUMMARY
## "Columns out of bounds" - FIXED!

**Error:** `Exception: Those columns are out of bounds.`  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**File Updated:** `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs`

---

## 🐛 **WHAT CAUSED THE ERROR**

The error occurred because:
1. Some tabs tried to access columns that didn't exist yet
2. Trial Length was in wrong cell (B26 vs B33)
3. Tabs were created in wrong order
4. Some formulas referenced tabs before they existed

---

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **Fix 1: Trial Length Cell**
**Before:** B26 (wrong)  
**After:** B33 (correct - referenced by formulas)

### **Fix 2: Lead Data Columns**
**Before:** Headers only, no column setup  
**After:** Full 34 columns (A-AH) with proper formatting

### **Fix 3: Settings Tab Structure**
**Before:** Missing validation config cells  
**After:** Complete structure with all required cells

### **Fix 4: Initialization Order**
**Before:**
```javascript
createHelpTabV2(ss);      // First
createSettingsTabV2(ss);  // Second
createLeadDataTabV2(ss);  // Third
```

**After:**
```javascript
createSettingsTabV2(ss);  // FIRST (others reference it!)
createHelpTabV2(ss);
// ... helper tabs ...
createLeadDataTabV2(ss);
// ... main tabs ...
createDashboardTabV2(ss); // LAST (references everything)
```

### **Fix 5: Safe Formulas**
All formulas now check for dependencies before running.
