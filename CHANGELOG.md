# 📋 Changelog - v2.2-alpha

## [2025-10-11] 🔧 Critical Fixes - Attribution & Formula Improvements (Batch 2)

### 📊 Overview
Implemented **9 total fixes** from comprehensive attribution analysis:
- **Batch 1 (Quick Wins):** 5 fixes addressing timezone, type checking, validation, case sensitivity, documentation
- **Batch 2 (High Priority):** 4 fixes addressing cell protection, capacity limits, division errors, dynamic ranges

### ✅ Fixes Implemented

#### Fix #1: Trial End Date Timezone Bug (30 min)
**Issue:** Date arithmetic didn't normalize timezone, causing off-by-one errors during DST transitions.

**Solution:** Added `DATEVALUE()` wrapper to trial end calculation (line 1532).

**Impact:**
- ✅ Trial end dates now calculate correctly regardless of timezone/DST
- ✅ "Trial ending soon" alerts fire on correct day
- ✅ No more off-by-one date errors

---

#### Fix #2: LTV:CAC Type Check (30 min)
**Issue:** Division attempted when CAC was string ("Spend/0") instead of number, causing #VALUE! errors.

**Solution:** Added `ISNUMBER()` checks for both avgLTV and avgCAC before division (line 1291).

**Impact:**
- ✅ LTV:CAC ratio shows "-" instead of errors when values are invalid
- ✅ Handles edge cases where CAC is "⚠️ Spend/0" string
- ✅ More robust error handling

---

#### Fix #3: Custom Date Range Validation (30 min)
**Issue:** No validation prevented End Date < Start Date for custom ranges, causing silent failures.

**Solution:** Split validation into two rules - B28 (start) requires date, B29 (end) requires date AFTER B28 (lines 1840-1857).

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users can no longer enter End < Start
- ✅ Prevents silent failures where metrics show 0
- ✅ Data validation provides clear error message

---

#### Fix #4: UTM Case Sensitivity (30 min)
**Issue:** `LOWER()` applied to incoming UTM source but not to Settings lookup table, causing case-sensitive mismatches.

**Solution:** Applied `LOWER()` to both sides using ARRAYFORMULA on the lookup table (line 2542-2550).

**Impact:**
- ✅ UTM mapping now case-insensitive on both sides
- ✅ "fb_ad", "FB_AD", and "Fb_Ad" all map correctly
- ✅ Fewer "⚠️ Unmapped" errors from case mismatches

---

#### Fix #5: Document 5K Row Limit (15 min)
**Issue:** Hard limit at 5,000 rows was undocumented to users, causing silent failures.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive documentation in Help tab (lines 2228-2257) and note on Lead Data A1 header (line 1504).

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users now aware of capacity limits
- ✅ Clear guidance on monitoring and solutions (archive, increase limit, export)
- ✅ No more surprise failures at row 5,001
- ✅ Encourages proactive data management

---

#### Fix #6: Protect Critical Settings Cells (1 hour)
**Issue:** Named ranges (rngStart, rngEnd) break if user inserts rows above row 30 in Settings tab.

**Solution:** Added warning-only protection to Settings rows 27-33 (lines 1979-2003).

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users warned before inserting/deleting critical rows
- ✅ Protection is warning-only (can override if needed)
- ✅ Prevents accidental DASHBOARD breakage
- ✅ Clear description explains why protection exists

---

#### Fix #7: Increase ARRAYFORMULA Limit to 10K (2-3 hours)
**Issue:** Hard limit at 5,000 rows was too restrictive, undocumented, and caused silent failures.

**Solution:** Increased _UTM Tracking formulas from A2:A5000 to A2:A10000 (line 2601). Updated Help tab and Lead Data header documentation (lines 2256-2282, 1504).

**Impact:**
- ✅ Doubled capacity from 5K to 10K rows
- ✅ 100 leads/month = 8+ years (was 4+ years)
- ✅ Clear documentation for users
- ✅ Warning threshold moved to 9,500 rows

---

#### Fix #8: Division By Zero Edge Cases (2 hours)
**Issue:** Rate formulas showed 0% instead of "N/A" when denominator was zero, implying poor performance instead of insufficient data.

**Solution:** Enhanced DASHBOARD rate formulas (lines 1002-1004) and Source Analysis rates (lines 1188, 1192-1201) to check denominator before division.

**Impact:**
- ✅ Set Rate shows "-" when 0 leads (not 0%)
- ✅ Show Rate shows "-" when 0 appointments (not 0%)
- ✅ Close Rate shows "-" when 0 shows (not 0%)
- ✅ Lead→Member Rate shows "-" when 0 leads (not 0%)
- ✅ Clearer distinction between "no data" vs "0% conversion"

## [2025-10-08] ✨ Enhancement - Setup Wizard Marketing Budget Extended

### 📊 Improvement
**Enhanced Setup Wizard to create 24 months of marketing budget rows** (12 months past + 12 months future) instead of only 12 months future.

### What Changed
- **Before:** Wizard created budget rows for current month + 11 future months (12 total)
- **After:** Wizard now creates budget rows for 12 past months + 12 future months (24 total)

### Benefits
- ✅ Immediate historical context when setting up a new sheet
- ✅ Can track year-over-year marketing performance from day one
- ✅ Better for gyms migrating from other systems with historical data
- ✅ Allows backfilling past marketing spend for accurate CAC calculations
- ✅ Provides 2 full years of budget planning capacity

### Example
If you run the wizard in October 2025 with 2 sources:
- **Old behavior:** Oct 2025 → Sep 2026 (12 months)
- **New behavior:** Oct 2024 → Sep 2026 (24 months) ✨

### Implementation Details
- Updated `quickStartWizard()` function (lines 773-791)
- Changed loop range from `monthOffset = 0` to `monthOffset = -12`
- Expanded clear range from `A40:E100` to `A40:E200`
- Automatically calculates correct year-month keys and days for all historical months

### User Impact
**No breaking changes** - This is a pure enhancement. Users running the wizard will simply get more pre-populated rows, making it easier to:
1. Track historical performance
2. Compare year-over-year trends
3. Backfill past marketing data
4. See seasonal patterns immediately

## [2025-10-08] 🔴 CRITICAL FIX - Lead Data "Trial Start" Column Addition

### Problem Fixed
**CRITICAL STRUCTURAL FIX:** Added missing "Trial Start" date column to Lead Data sheet.

**Root Cause:** The "Start Trial?" checkbox column (P) was missing its corresponding date column, causing the checkbox to be replaced with a date when checked - breaking the UX pattern and causing downstream formula failures.

### Solution Implemented
- ✅ **Added Column Q:** "Trial Start" (date) - auto-fills when "Start Trial?" checkbox (P) is checked
- ✅ **Shifted all subsequent columns** by +1 position (Q→R, R→S, S→T, etc.)
- ✅ **Updated 60+ formulas** across DASHBOARD, LTV Analysis, Chart Data, and Metrics tabs
- ✅ **Fixed Trial End formula** to correctly reference Trial Start date (Q) instead of checkbox (P)
- ✅ **Updated all column constants** in constants.gs
- ✅ **Enhanced onEdit handler** to fill date column instead of replacing checkbox

### Impact
**Before:** Checkbox → Date (checkbox disappeared ❌)  
**After:** Checkbox stays, adjacent date column auto-fills ✅

**Pattern Now Consistent:**
- Appt Set? (L) → Appt Date (M) ✅
- Show? (N) → Show Date (O) ✅  
- **Start Trial? (P) → Trial Start (Q) ✅ FIXED!**
- Converted? (S) → Member Start (T) ✅
- Cancelled? (X) → Cancel Date (Y) ✅

### Files Modified
- `constants.gs` - Added TRIAL_START_DATE constant, shifted all subsequent columns
- `Code.gs` - Updated onEdit handler, createLeadDataTab, createMembersTab, createLTVCalculationsTab, all DASHBOARD formulas
- All column references after P updated globally

### New Total Columns
**33 columns** (was 32): A-Z, AA-AH

### Testing Status
✅ All formulas verified  
✅ DASHBOARD metrics accurate  
✅ LTV Analysis calculations correct  
✅ Members tab filtering works  
✅ End-to-end workflow tested  
⏳ Ready for user testing

### Documentation
See `LEAD-DATA-STRUCTURAL-FIX-CHANGELOG.md` for complete technical details.

## [2025-10-08] UI Simplification - Removed "Goal To Date" Column

### 🎨 UI Improvement
**Removed:** "Goal To Date" column from DASHBOARD KEY METRICS section

**Rationale:**
- Simplified metrics table from 6 columns to 5 columns
- Variance now calculates directly: Actual - Target (instead of Actual - Goal To Date)
- Cleaner, more straightforward comparison
- Less visual clutter on DASHBOARD

**Changes:**
- Headers: Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Status (removed "Goal To Date")
- Variance column shifted from E to D
- Status column shifted from F to E
- Formulas updated: Variance = B - C (was B - D)
- Status formulas updated to reference new column positions
- Conditional formatting updated for new Status column (E10:E16)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Simpler, cleaner DASHBOARD layout
- ✅ Direct comparison between Actual vs Target
- ✅ All formulas updated correctly
- ✅ Conditional formatting preserved

---

## [2025-10-08] CRITICAL FIX - Formula Bug Root Cause Resolved

### 🚨 Critical Bug Fix
**Root Cause Identified and Fixed:** Apps Script was creating broken formulas

**Location:** `Code.gs` line 1009-1012 in `createDashboardTab()` function

**The Bug:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN) - Loop referenced header row B2
for (let i = 2; i <= 7; i++) {
  sheet.getRange(8 + i, 3).setFormula(`=IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B${i},"⚠️ Setup")`);
}
```

**The Fix:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED) - Explicitly reference data rows B3-B9
sheet.getRange('C10').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B3,"⚠️ Setup")'); // Leads
sheet.getRange('C11').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B4,"⚠️ Setup")'); // Set Rate
sheet.getRange('C12').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B5,"⚠️ Setup")'); // Show Rate
sheet.getRange('C13').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B6,"⚠️ Setup")'); // Close Rate
sheet.getRange('C14').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B7,"⚠️ Setup")'); // New Members
sheet.getRange('C15').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B8,"⚠️ Setup")'); // MRR
sheet.getRange('C16').setFormula('=IFERROR(\'Settings & Budget\'!B9,"⚠️ Setup")'); // CAC
```

### Fixed
- ✅ DASHBOARD Target column (C10-C16) now creates correct formulas
- ✅ Prevents "Target" text appearing instead of numeric values
- ✅ Ensures Goal To Date, Variance, and Status columns work correctly
- ✅ Future re-initializations will create correct formulas
- ✅ New sheet copies will work correctly from the start

### Impact
- **28 cells affected** by this bug (7 target cells + 21 dependent cascade cells)
- **Manual fixes were temporary** - running Initialize Template would re-break it
- **Now permanent** - root cause eliminated in the code itself

### Documentation Added
Created comprehensive audit and implementation documentation:
- `CODE-FIX-REQUIRED.md` - Critical code fix details
- `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - 50+ page detailed implementation guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION-VISUAL-TIMELINE.md` - Visual implementation guide
- `FORMULA-AUDIT-REPORT.md` - 150+ page comprehensive analysis
- `FORMULA-FIXES-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference guide
- `FORMULA-ERROR-MAP.md` - Visual dependency diagrams
- `FORMULA-AUDIT-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` - Business case analysis
- `FORMULA-AUDIT-ONE-PAGE-SUMMARY.md` - Print-friendly summary
- `100-PERCENT-CONFIDENCE-SUMMARY.md` - Complete confidence analysis

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause:** Off-by-one error in loop (started at i=2 instead of i=3)
- **Effect:** C10 referenced B2 (header "Target") instead of B3 (data)
- **Cascade:** Text in numeric calculation caused #VALUE! errors downstream
- **Prevention:** Explicit cell assignments instead of loop, clearer comments

K  Appt Set?           X  Notes
L  Appt Date           Y  Current Status (auto)
M  Show?
```

#### 3. Unified DASHBOARD Tab

**Before (3 separate tabs):**
- Scoreboard (KPIs, on-pace)
- Member Health (trials, renewals, birthdays)
- Follow-ups (action items)

**After (1 unified DASHBOARD):**
- Section 1: KPIs & On-Pace Status
- Section 2: Action Items (no appt set, no shows, expiring trials)
- Section 3: Member Alerts (trials ending, birthdays)
- Section 4: Trends (active members chart)

**Result:** One-page morning check instead of 3 tabs.

#### 4. Quick Start Wizard (NEW)

**Before:**
- Manual initialization
- Read docs to customize
- ~30 minutes setup

**After:**
- Interactive 4-step wizard
- Customization prompts
- ~2 minutes setup

**Steps:**
1. Gym name (renames spreadsheet)
2. Monthly goal (sets targets)
3. Lead sources (keep defaults or customize later?)
4. Sample data (add 20 test leads?)

#### 5. Formula-Based Dates (Removed onEdit Trigger)

**Before:**
- onEdit trigger watches for checkbox changes
- Auto-stamps hidden date columns (AF, AG, AH, AI)
- "Magic" behavior confuses users

**After:**
- Simple formulas: Trial End = Trial Start + 14
- Current Status derived from checkboxes
- Transparent, no hidden behavior

**Trade-off:** Dates don't "lock" once set, but simpler to understand.

#### 6. Auto-Created Charts

**Before:**
- Charts defined in code
- Manual slicer setup required
- Users often skip this step

**After:**
- Charts auto-positioned on DASHBOARD
- No manual setup needed
- Active Members Trend (90 days) created instantly

#### 7. No Protections

**Before:**
- 12 protected sheets (warning-only)
- Users click through warnings anyway
- Slows down legitimate edits

**After:**
- No protections
- Visual cues instead (green background = auto-calculated)
- Faster editing, trust your team

#### 8. Removed Complexity

**Removed entirely:**
- **Cohorts tab:** 30/60/90 day retention analysis (95% won't use)
- **Snapshots tab:** Nightly backups (version history exists)
- **Mappings tab:** UTM standardization (just use dropdowns)

**Result:** Less to learn, faster to use.

#### 9. Unified Settings Tab

**Before:**
- Lists tab (dropdowns)
- Targets tab (goals + date range)
- Mappings tab (source standardization)

**After:**
- Single Settings tab with sections:
  - Monthly Targets
  - Dropdown Lists
  - Date Range Controls
  - Other Settings

**Result:** All config in one place.

#### 10. Code Simplification

**Before:**
- 1,325 lines of Apps Script
- Complex onEdit trigger logic
- Protection management
- Snapshot scheduling

**After:**
- 700 lines of Apps Script (47% reduction)
- Simple formulas instead of triggers
- No protections to manage
- No time-based triggers

**Result:** Easier to maintain, faster to initialize.
