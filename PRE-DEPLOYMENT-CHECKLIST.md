## 🔍 WHAT WAS FIXED IN CODE REVIEW

### Technical Issue: AND() in ARRAYFORMULA
**Problem:** Google Sheets `AND()` function only works on single values, not arrays.

**Example of What Was Broken:**
```javascript
IF(AND(O2:O5000<>"", ISNUMBER(O2:O5000)), "Trial", ...)
```
❌ This would fail with #VALUE! error

**Fixed To:**
```javascript
IF((O2:O5000<>"")*ISNUMBER(O2:O5000), "Trial", ...)
```
✅ Uses multiplication to combine boolean conditions (works with arrays)

**Why This Works:**
- `TRUE * TRUE = 1` (truthy in IF statements)
- `TRUE * FALSE = 0` (falsy)
- `FALSE * FALSE = 0` (falsy)
