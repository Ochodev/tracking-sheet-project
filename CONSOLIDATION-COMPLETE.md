## 📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION

### **Before Consolidation**:
**Problems**:
- 31 columns in Lead Data = horizontal scroll hell
- Multiple tabs for same purpose (Staff View vs Sales View)
- No easy way to see just what you need

**User Pain**:
- Front desk: "I have to scroll through 31 columns just to enter a phone number!"
- Sales: "Where's the lead score column? I can't find it!"
- Manager: "I just want to see today's numbers quickly!"

---

### **After Consolidation**:
**Solutions**:
- Column groups = collapse what you don't need
- One Mobile View = role selector shows relevant columns
- Dynamic content = same tab, different experience

**User Joy**:
- Front desk: "I collapsed everything but core columns - it all fits on my phone now!"
- Sales: "I set it to Sales mode - leads sorted by score, perfect!"
- Manager: "Manager mode shows me today's stats in 3 seconds!"
