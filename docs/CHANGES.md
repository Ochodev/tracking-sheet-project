## Change History

## [2025-10-14] - Added .cursorignore to Prevent Referencing Archived Files

### Version
- **Version:** 2.2.3
- **Status:** Complete

### Changed
- **Files Created:**
  - `.cursorignore` - Added `_archive/` to prevent Cursor from indexing old docs
- **Files Updated:**
  - `.cursorrules` - Added warning to NEVER reference `_archive/`

### What Changed
Added `.cursorignore` file with `_archive/` entry to prevent AI/Cursor from referencing outdated documentation when making code changes.

### Why Changed
- User correctly identified risk: archived docs contain wrong info (v2.1, 4,560 lines, old architecture)
- If AI references old docs, could create code with wrong cell references, outdated patterns
- `.cursorignore` prevents Cursor from indexing those files
- Explicit rule in `.cursorrules` reinforces this

### Impact Analysis
**Affected:**
- AI assistant behavior (won't see archived files)
- Cursor indexing (ignores _archive/)
- Safety (prevents incorrect changes based on old docs)

**Depends On:**
- Nothing

**Breaks If:**
- N/A (safety improvement)

### Test Results
- [x] .cursorignore created: PASS
- [x] _archive/ entry added: PASS
- [x] .cursorrules updated: PASS
- [x] Files still accessible manually: PASS (for reference)

### Rollback Plan
**If issues occur:**
1. Delete `.cursorignore` if needed
2. Expected rollback time: 30 seconds

### Notes
- **Critical insight:** User realized that having outdated docs in workspace could cause AI to reference wrong info
- `.cursorignore` is like `.gitignore` but for Cursor IDE
- Files still exist in `_archive/` for manual reference, just not indexed
- This prevents "hallucinations" based on old documentation

## [2025-10-14] - Archived Outdated Documentation & Updated README

### Version
- **Version:** 2.2.3
- **Status:** Complete

### Changed
- **Files Archived:**
  - `CONTEXT.md` → `_archive/` (described v2.1, 4,560 lines - actual is v2.2.3, 2,580 lines)
  - `DATA-FLOW.md` → `_archive/` (described v2.1 architecture)
- **Files Updated:**
  - `README.md` - Updated to accurately reflect v2.2.3 (13 tabs, 34 columns, 2,580 lines)

### What Changed
Archived outdated documentation that conflicted with current codebase:
1. `CONTEXT.md` claimed v2.1-beta with 4,560 lines (actual: v2.2.3 with 2,580 lines)
2. `DATA-FLOW.md` described old v2.1 architecture
3. Updated `README.md` to accurately describe current v2.2.3 system
4. Now only ONE README in root, all detailed docs in `docs/` folder

### Why Changed
- User identified that outdated docs were creating confusion and conflicts
- Old docs contradicted new `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/CELL-REFERENCE-MAP.md`
- Multiple versions of documentation (CONTEXT, DATA-FLOW, new docs/) caused confusion
- Need single source of truth for current system

### Impact Analysis
**Affected:**
- Documentation clarity (much better now!)
- Developer onboarding (clearer path)
- Reduced confusion about system architecture

**Depends On:**
- Nothing (documentation change only)

**Breaks If:**
- N/A (no code changes)

### Test Results
- [x] Root directory clean: PASS (only README.md + GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs)
- [x] README.md accurate: PASS (reflects v2.2.3 reality)
- [x] Old docs archived: PASS (available for reference)
- [x] No documentation conflicts: PASS

### Rollback Plan
**If issues occur:**
1. Copy files back from _archive/ if needed
2. Expected rollback time: 1 minute

### Notes
- **Key insight:** User correctly identified that old docs (v2.1, 4,560 lines) didn't match current code (v2.2.3, 2,580 lines - 43% smaller!)
- Old docs described features that may not exist or work differently
- Now have clean separation: README.md (overview) + docs/ (detailed) + _archive/ (historical)
- This is the CORRECT way to document changes (in CHANGES.md, not creating new .md files!)

## [2025-10-14] - Repository Cleanup: Removed Redundant Files & Updated Rules

### Version
- **Version:** 2.2.3
- **Status:** Complete

### Changed
- **Files Archived:**
  - `Code.gs` → `_archive/` (legacy v2.1-beta version)
  - `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs` → `_archive/` (manual backup)
  - `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs.bak` → `_archive/` (backup of backup)
  - `CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` → `_archive/` (unnecessary documentation file)
  - `CLEANUP-COMPLETE.md` → `_archive/` (unnecessary documentation file)
  - `RULES-UPDATE-COMPLETE.md` → `_archive/` (unnecessary documentation file)
  - `FINAL-CLEANUP-COMPLETE.md` → `_archive/` (unnecessary documentation file)
- **Files Updated:**
  - `.cursorrules` - Added "Do NOT create separate .md files for every change" rule
  - `README.md` - Updated file structure to show single production file

### What Changed
Cleaned up repository structure:
1. Removed redundant code files (we only need GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs)
2. Archived manual backup files (git handles version control)
3. Updated cursor rules to prevent creating unnecessary .md files
4. Archived cleanup summary files (broke the rule we just created!)

### Why Changed
- Git provides version control - no need for manual backups
- Multiple similar files created confusion about "source of truth"
- We kept creating new .md files for every change (defeating the purpose)
- Need single production file for clarity

### Impact Analysis
**Affected:**
- File structure (cleaner, simpler)
- Development workflow (one file to edit)
- Documentation workflow (use CHANGES.md instead of new files)

**Depends On:**
- Nothing (organizational change only)

**Breaks If:**
- N/A (no code changes)

### Test Results
- [x] Production file exists: PASS
- [x] Backup files archived: PASS
- [x] Rules updated: PASS
- [x] Root directory clean: PASS (only 3 .md files)

### Rollback Plan
**If issues occur:**
1. Copy files back from _archive/ if needed
2. Expected rollback time: 1 minute

### Notes
- **Key lesson:** We created the rule "don't make .md files for every change" then immediately made 4 .md files documenting the cleanup. User correctly called this out!
- Now properly documenting in CHANGES.md as intended
- Production file structure: Only `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs` in root
- All old versions available in `_archive/` for reference

## [2025-10-14] - Fixed SOURCE ANALYSIS Spend, CPL, CPA, CPS, CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC Columns

### Version
- **Version:** 2.2.2
- **Status:** Deployed

### Changed
- **File:** GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs
- **Lines:** 970-992 (Spend formula), 1007 (LTV formula)
- **File:** GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs
- **Lines:** 964-986 (Spend formula), 1000 (LTV formula)
- **Commit:** [pending]

### What Changed
1. **Spend Formula (G20):** Replaced simple SUMIFS with MAP/LAMBDA approach
   - Old: `SUMIFS('Settings & Budget'!$E$44:$E$67,...)`
   - New: Complex MAP/LAMBDA with date overlap logic
   - Fixed row range: 44:67 → 40:100
   - Fixed column: Still E (Daily Rate)
   - Added date range filtering

2. **LTV Formula (L20):** Replaced INDEX/MATCH with VLOOKUP
   - Old: `INDEX('_LTV Calculations'!T:T, MATCH(...))`
   - New: `VLOOKUP(A20:A30,'_LTV Calculations'!N:T,7,FALSE)`
   - VLOOKUP works better with ARRAYFORMULA

### Why Changed
- User reported all 7 columns showing 0 or blank
- Root cause 1: Marketing Budget row range too narrow (missing rows 40-43)
- Root cause 2: No date range filtering in Spend calculation
- Root cause 3: INDEX/MATCH doesn't array-expand in ARRAYFORMULA

### Impact Analysis
**Affected:**
- Tab: DASHBOARD
- Cells: G20:G30 (Spend), H20:M30 (all dependent cost metrics)
- Feature: SOURCE ANALYSIS per-source analytics

**Depends On:**
- Settings & Budget A40:E100 (Marketing Budget table)
- Settings B30:B31 (Date range)
- _LTV Calculations N:T (LTV by source table)

**Breaks If:**
- Marketing Budget moves to different rows
- Date range cells change location
- _LTV Calculations table structure changes

### Test Results
- [x] Health Check: PASS
- [x] Quick Test: PASS  
- [x] Validate & Auto-Fix: PASS
- [x] Manual DASHBOARD check: PASS - All columns show values
- [x] Manual Members check: PASS

### Rollback Plan
**If issues occur:**
1. Restore from: `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs.bak` (pre-fix version)
2. Or use: `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs.bak`
3. Expected rollback time: 2 minutes

### Notes
- This was a critical fix preventing cost analysis
- All dependent columns (CPL, CPA, CPS, CAC, LTV:CAC) automatically fixed when Spend and LTV were corrected
- No changes needed to Code.gs (it has different section layout)

### Test Results
- [x] Code compiles: PASS
- [x] No syntax errors: PASS
- [x] Documentation complete: PASS

### Rollback Plan
**If issues occur:**
1. Remove CELL_REFS section (lines 133-272)
2. Keep documentation (no code impact)
3. Expected rollback time: 1 minute

### Notes
