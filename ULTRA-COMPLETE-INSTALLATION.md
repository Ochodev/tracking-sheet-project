**From:** `tabs-refactored.gs` (lines 949-1171)  
**Copy:** The entire `createSettingsTabV2(ss)` function  
**Paste:** Replace the placeholder in your ultra-complete file  

**Same file locations:**
```
Settings & Budget  → tabs-refactored.gs (line 949)
Lead Data          → lead-data-refactored.gs (line 16)
DASHBOARD          → dashboard-refactored.gs (line 24)
LTV Analysis       → tabs-refactored.gs (line 458)
_Metrics           → tabs-refactored.gs (line 166)
_Chart Data        → tabs-refactored.gs (line 255)
