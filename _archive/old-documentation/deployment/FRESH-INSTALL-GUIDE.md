## üéì UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

### **Key Concepts:**

**Lead Flow:**
```
Lead Created ‚Üí Appt Set ‚Üí Show ‚Üí Trial ‚Üí Member ‚Üí (Active/Cancelled)
```

**Tab Purposes:**
```
DASHBOARD = View metrics and action items
Lead Data = Enter and track all leads
Members = View active members only
Settings & Budget = Configure system and budgets
LTV Analysis = Analyze customer lifetime value
Import Members = One-time import of existing members (optional)
```

**Smart Auto-Calculations:**
```
‚úÖ Source = Auto-mapped from UTM data
‚úÖ Trial End = Auto-calculated from Trial Start + length
‚úÖ Current Status = Auto-determined from checkboxes
‚úÖ Age = Auto-calculated days since created
‚úÖ Lead Score = Auto-scored (Hot/Warm/Cold)
‚úÖ Action Needed = Smart next step recommendation
‚úÖ Days to Convert = Auto-calculated conversion time
```

### **Data Validations:**

The system prevents errors with:
- Dropdown lists (Sources, Staff, Types, Reasons)
- Checkbox fields (Appt Set, Show, Converted, etc.)
- Date validation (chronological order checking)
- Duplicate detection (phone/email)
- Number validation (MRR, budgets)
