## Deployment (2 Minutes)

1. Copy `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs`
2. Extensions â†’ Apps Script
3. Delete all Code.gs
4. Paste new code
5. Save (Cmd+S)
6. Close Apps Script
7. Refresh sheet (F5)
8. Wait 30 sec for menu
9. Gym Ops â†’ Initialize Template V2
10. Done!

## If You Get Errors

**Syntax Error in Apps Script:**
- Check you copied the ENTIRE file
- Make sure no characters were cut off
- Try copying in smaller chunks

**#REF! in DASHBOARD:**
- Verify _Metrics tab exists and is hidden
- Verify _LTV Calculations tab exists
- Re-run Initialize if needed

**#ERROR! in formulas:**
- Note which cell (e.g., G20)
- Note which phase
- Report to me with exact error

**Source shows "Not Tracked":**
- Phase 9 might have failed
- Check _UTM Tracking has data
- Verify column O is populated

---

## Success Indicators

After all testing:

âœ… All 10 phases passed  
âœ… No #ERROR! in any cell  
âœ… No #REF! in any cell  
âœ… Sample leads populate correctly  
âœ… DASHBOARD shows all metrics  
âœ… Source Analysis fully functional  
âœ… New Revenue section working  

**You should see:**
- DASHBOARD with 8 sections (all working)
- Members showing active members only
- LTV Analysis with populated data
- Settings with marketing budget
- Lead Data with auto-calculated columns
