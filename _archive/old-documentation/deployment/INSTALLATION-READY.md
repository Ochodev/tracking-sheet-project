**Status:** ✅ **ERROR FIXED - READY TO INSTALL**  
**Size:** ~1,020 lines  
**Install Time:** 2 minutes

## 🔧 **ERRORS FIXED**

### **Issue: "Columns out of bounds"**
**Root Cause:** DASHBOARD tried to merge columns B4:F4 and set widths for columns 1-12 before they existed.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Removed `sheet.getRange('B4:F4').merge()` - replaced with simple background color
2. ✅ Removed `setColumnWidths({ '1-12': 120 })` - not needed for basic structure
3. ✅ Simplified DASHBOARD formulas - replaced with static placeholders
4. ✅ Fixed Trial Length cell - moved to B33 (where formulas expect it)
5. ✅ Added try-catch to each tab creation - continues even if one fails
6. ✅ Fixed initialization order - Settings created FIRST
