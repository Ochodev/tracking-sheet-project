## üö® 3 CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED

| # | Issue | Time | Status |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Missing Source formula in Lead Data | 5 min | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Fixed |
| 2 | #REF! error in Members tab | 5 min | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Fixed |
| 3 | Enter Marketing Budget data | 15 min | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Fixed |

## üî¥ FIX #1: Add Source Formula to Lead Data (5 min)

### Problem:
Column H (Source) is empty for all 40 leads. DASHBOARD shows 0 leads for all sources.

### Fix:
1. **Open the sheet:** [Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nMO73a43mWHKmB3WHJpX6ObTAsz3T1O5ab7PVwyZW8I/edit)
2. **Go to `Lead Data` tab**
3. **Click cell H2**
4. **Copy and paste this formula:**
   ```
   =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="","",IFERROR(INDEX('_UTM Tracking'!O:O, MATCH(A2:A, '_UTM Tracking'!A:A, 0)),"‚ö†Ô∏è Not Tracked")))
   ```
5. **Press Enter**
6. **Verify:** All 40 leads should now show "‚ö†Ô∏è Not Tracked" in column H

### Why This Works:
This formula looks up each Lead ID in the `_UTM Tracking` tab and returns the source. Since `_UTM Tracking` is empty (it's populated by GHL), it shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Not Tracked" for all leads. Once GHL integration is live, sources will auto-populate.

### ‚úÖ Success Check:
- [ ] H2 contains formula (not empty)
- [ ] H3-H41 show "‚ö†Ô∏è Not Tracked"
- [ ] DASHBOARD Source Analysis still shows 0 (expected until GHL integration)

---

## üî¥ FIX #2: Fix Members Tab #REF! Error (5 min)

### Problem:
Members tab shows #REF! error. Cannot see active members. Summary shows -1 members.

### Fix:
1. **Go to `Members` tab**
2. **Click cell A2**
3. **Copy and paste this formula:**
   ```
   =QUERY('Lead Data'!A:AH, "SELECT * WHERE S=TRUE AND X<>TRUE ORDER BY T DESC", 1)
   ```
4. **Press Enter**
5. **Verify:** Should see 5 active members (rows 3-7)

### If Still Shows #REF!:
The issue might be that there are no converted members with Converted=TRUE AND Cancelled=FALSE.

**Check Lead Data:**
1. Go to `Lead Data` tab
2. Scroll right to column S (Converted?)
3. Count how many rows have ‚úÖ checked
4. For those rows, scroll right to column X (Cancelled?)
5. Verify Cancelled? is ‚òê unchecked

**If no converted members exist:**
- The formula is correct but no data matches
- This is expected if sheet is new
- Once you convert leads (check column S), they'll appear in Members tab

### ‚úÖ Success Check:
- [ ] A2 contains QUERY formula (not #REF!)
- [ ] If 5 converted members exist, rows 3-7 show their data
- [ ] K4 (Total Members) shows 5 (not -1)
- [ ] K5 (Active MRR) shows $1,251 (not $0)

---

## üü° FIX #3: Enter Marketing Budget Data (15 min)

### Problem:
Marketing Budget section is empty. DASHBOARD can't calculate CAC. All sources show "Organic".

### Fix:
1. **Go to `Settings & Budget` tab**
2. **Scroll down to row 42** (üí∞ MARKETING BUDGET (Monthly) header)
3. **For each month you've spent on marketing:**
   - **Column A:** Month (already filled: 2024-10, 2024-11, etc.)
   - **Column B:** Click dropdown, select Source (Paid Search, Paid Social, etc.)
   - **Column C:** Enter monthly budget amount ($)
   - **Columns D & E:** Auto-calculate (don't touch)

### Example Data:
If you spent on marketing in Sept-Oct 2025, enter:

| Row | Month | Source | Monthly Budget ($) | Days | Daily Rate |
|-----|-------|--------|-------------------|------|-----------|
| 56 | 2025-09 | Paid Search | $2,000 | 30 | $66.67 |
| 57 | 2025-10 | Paid Search | $2,500 | 31 | $80.65 |
| 57 | 2025-10 | Paid Social | $1,000 | 31 | $32.26 |

**Notes:**
- You can have multiple rows for the same month (different sources)
- Columns D (Days in Month) and E (Daily Rate) auto-calculate
- Only enter data for months you actually spent money
- Leave other months blank

### If You Don't Have Marketing Spend:
That's OK! The system will still work. Just means:
- CAC will show $0 or "Organic"
- LTV:CAC ratio won't calculate
- You're tracking organic leads only

### ‚úÖ Success Check:
- [ ] At least 1 row has Source selected (Column B)
- [ ] At least 1 row has Budget entered (Column C)
- [ ] Days and Daily Rate auto-calculated (green cells, Columns D & E)
- [ ] DASHBOARD G20 no longer shows #ERROR! (may show $0 if date range doesn't match budget months)

## üìä DASHBOARD CHECK

After fixes, your DASHBOARD should show:

### TODAY'S SNAPSHOT (Expected):
- üî• HOT Leads: 0 (no hot leads in sample data)
- üí∞ Active MRR: $1,251 (from 5 converted members)

### KEY METRICS (Expected):
- Leads: 40 (Target 200) ‚Üí üìâ BEHIND
- Set %: 50.0% (Target 60%) ‚Üí üìâ BEHIND

- New Members: 5 (Target 42) ‚Üí üìâ BEHIND
- MRR: $1,251 (Target $4,500) ‚Üí üìâ BEHIND
- CAC: Depends on your budget data

### SOURCE ANALYSIS (Expected):
**Before Fix #1:**
- All sources show 0 leads

**After Fix #1:**
- All sources still show 0 (because Source column shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Not Tracked")
- This is correct! Sources will populate when GHL integration is live

**After GHL Integration:**
- Sources will show lead counts
- Spend will calculate based on your budget data
- CAC will show calculated values
