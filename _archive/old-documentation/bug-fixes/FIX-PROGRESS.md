## ðŸ’¡ **KEY LEARNINGS**

### **Column Shift Pattern:**
After adding Trial Start Date (Q), all columns from R onward shifted by +1:
- **P** (Trial Start checkbox) â†’ No change
- **Q** (Trial Start Date) â†’ **NEW!**
- **R-AH** â†’ All shifted +1 position

### **Common Mistakes Found:**
1. **Converted checkbox:** Q â†’ S (most common error)
2. **Member Start:** R â†’ T
3. **MRR:** T â†’ V
4. **Cancelled checkbox:** V â†’ X
5. **Lead Score:** AB â†’ AD
6. **Trial End:** P â†’ R (when checking dates, not checkbox)

### **Testing Strategy:**
For each fix, verify:
- Formula syntax is correct
- Column references match constants.gs
- Logic makes sense (e.g., checking dates vs booleans)
- Related formulas updated together
