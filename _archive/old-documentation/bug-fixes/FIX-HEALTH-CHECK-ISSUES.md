# üîß FIX: Health Check Issues

**Sheet:** ggg - Gym Ops  
**Issues Found:** 9 (dropdown corruption + missing backup trigger)  
**Fix Time:** 2 minutes  
**Solution:** Run automated cleanup function

---

## üéØ WHAT'S WRONG

Your health check found **data corruption** in Settings & Budget dropdown lists:

### **The Problem:**
The dropdown list areas (rows 14-24) are picking up data from the Marketing Budget section (rows 38+), causing:

- ‚ùå **Blank rows** in dropdowns (60-90 blanks each)
- ‚ùå **Duplicates** from budget data:
  - "Paid Search", "Paid Social" appearing in Staff column
  - Dollar amounts ($41.23, $42.60) in Cancel Reasons
  - Numbers (28, 30, 31) in Membership Types
- ‚ùå **Missing backup trigger**

### **Root Cause:**
The health check reads up to 100 rows per dropdown column and doesn't properly stop at section boundaries. It's reading budget data as if it were dropdown data.

**Step 1:** Update Your Apps Script
```
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script

3. Or minimal issues (just blank rows, no duplicates/corruption)
```

---

### **Option 2: Manual Cleanup** (5-10 minutes)

If you can't deploy the code fix right now:

**Fix Staff Column (B14-B100):**
```
1. Go to Settings & Budget tab
2. Select range B15:B100 (below your staff names)
3. Press Delete
4. Keep only: mike, Coach A, Coach B (or your custom staff)
```

**Fix Types Column (D14-D100):**
```
1. Select range D18:D100 (below PT, Small Group, General, Class Pack)
2. Press Delete
3. Keep only the 4 membership types
```

**Fix Cancel Reasons Column (E14-E100):**
```
1. Select range E20:E100 (below Price, Moved, Injury, Service, Location, Other)
2. Press Delete  
3. Keep only the 6 cancel reasons
```

**Fix Status Values (G14-G100):**
```
1. Select range G20:G100
2. Press Delete
3. Keep only: Lead, Appt Set, Show, Trial, Member, Cancelled
```

**Add Separator:**
```
1. Click cell A36
2. Type: ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
3. Format as gray color
4. This prevents health check from reading too far
```

**Fix Backup Trigger:**
```
1. Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
2. Run ‚Üí setupMonthlyBackup (from dropdown)
3. Grant permissions if prompted
4. Check execution log - should say "trigger created"
```

## üîç UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUE

### **What Happened:**

The dropdown list columns (A, B, D, E, G) should only have data in rows 14-24. However, the Marketing Budget section starts at row 38 and uses columns A-E for:

| Row | A (Month) | B (Source) | C (Budget) | D (Days) | E (Rate) |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|----------|----------|
| 40 | 2025-10 | Paid Search | $2,500 | 31 | $80.65 |
| 41 | 2025-10 | Paid Social | $1,500 | 31 | $48.39 |

The health check function reads B14:B100 and doesn't realize row 40+ is a different section, so it reports:
- "Paid Search", "Paid Social" as Staff (they're actually Sources in budget section)
- "$41.23", "$42.60" as Cancel Reasons (they're actually daily rates)
- "30", "31", "28" as Types (they're actually days in month)

### **The Fix:**

**Automated cleanup:**
1. Clears rows 14-24 completely
2. Rewrites with expected dropdown values
3. Removes any stray data between sections
4. Adds visual separator at row 36
5. Sets up backup trigger

**Result:** Clean, organized dropdown lists that health check reads correctly

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

### **After Cleanup:**

**Health Check Should Show:**
```
‚úÖ Health Check Passed
No issues detected.
```

**Or Minimal Issues:**
```
(Maybe a few blank rows if your custom lists are shorter than expected - that's OK)
```

**Dropdown Lists Should Contain:**

| Column | Name | Expected Values | Rows |
|--------|------|-----------------|------|
| A14-A24 | Sources | Paid Search, Paid Social, Direct Traffic, etc. | 11 items |
| B14-B16 | Staff | mike, Coach A, Coach B (or your custom names) | 3+ items |
| C14 | Location | ggg (your gym name) | 1 item |
| D14-D17 | Types | PT, Small Group, General, Class Pack | 4 items |
| E14-E19 | Cancel Reasons | Price, Moved, Injury, Service, Location, Other | 6 items |
| G14-G19 | Status | Lead, Appt Set, Show, Trial, Member, Cancelled | 6 items |

**Rows 25-35:** Empty (buffer zone)  
**Row 36:** Separator (‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ)  
**Rows 38+:** Marketing Budget section (untouched)

---

## üéØ VERIFICATION STEPS

‚ñ° Dropdown should show 11 clean sources (no duplicates, no budget data)
‚ñ° Click any Staff cell (column J)
‚ñ° Dropdown should show only staff names (no "Paid Search")
```

**3. Health Check:**
```
‚ñ° Run: Gym Ops ‚Üí Run Health Check
‚ñ° Should pass or show minimal issues
‚ñ° NO duplicates reported
‚ñ° NO corruption reported
```

**4. Backup Trigger:**
```

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Cleanup function not in menu
**Solution:**
```
You haven't deployed the updated Code.gs yet
Deploy the code first, then reload sheet
Menu item will appear
```

### Issue: Cleanup doesn't fix everything
**Solution:**
```
Use Manual Cleanup (Option 2 above)
Delete rows manually
More control over what's kept
```

### Issue: Health check still shows issues
**Solution:**
```
The health check may be too sensitive
If it's just "blank rows" and counts are low (<10), that's OK
If it's duplicates or corruption, run cleanup again
```

### Issue: Lost custom dropdown values
**Solution:**
```
Cleanup resets to defaults for most lists
To preserve custom values:
1. Note your custom values before cleanup
2. Add them back after in Settings & Budget
3. Or use Manual Cleanup for finer control
```
