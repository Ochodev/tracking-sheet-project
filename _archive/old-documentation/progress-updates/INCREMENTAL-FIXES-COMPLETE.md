# Incremental Bug Fixes - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Version:** 2.2.4 (Incremental Fixes)  
**File:** `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs`  
**Status:** ALL 10 PHASES COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING

---

## What Was Fixed

### Phase 1: Trial End Formula (CRITICAL)
**Line:** 735  
**Issue:** Trial End column (R) not calculating dates  
**Fix:** Changed ARRAYFORMULA logic to use ROW() check and proper empty logic

**Before:**
```javascript
'ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="","",IF(Q2:Q<>"",Q2:Q+\'Settings & Budget\'!$B$33,"")))'
```

**After:**
```javascript
'=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(ROW(A2:A)=0,"",IF(Q2:Q="","",Q2:Q+\'Settings & Budget\'!$B$33)))'
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open Lead Data tab
2. Check that R2 has a formula (not blank)
3. Add a date in Q3 (Trial Start)
4. Verify R3 = Q3 + 14 days
5. Clear Q3, verify R3 becomes empty

---

### Phase 2: Members Tab QUERY (CRITICAL)
**Line:** 423  
**Issue:** None - formula was already correct  
**Status:** VERIFIED - No changes needed

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open Members tab
2. Verify A2 shows formula
3. Add converted member (Converted? = TRUE, Cancelled? = FALSE)
4. Verify member appears in Members tab
5. Check Summary box (K4) shows correct count

---

### Phase 3: Dashboard CAC Formula (HIGH)
**Line:** 916  
**Issue:** Overly complex LET/LAMBDA/BYROW formula causing errors  
**Fix:** Simplified to basic SUMIFS with date range filtering

**Before:**
```javascript
LET(startDate,...,BYROW(...,LAMBDA(...)))  // 300+ characters
```

**After:**
```javascript
IFERROR(IF(B14=0,"-",SUMIFS('Settings & Budget'!C44:C67,'Settings & Budget'!A44:A67,">="&TEXT('Settings & Budget'!B30,"yyyy-mm"),'Settings & Budget'!A44:A67,"<="&TEXT('Settings & Budget'!B31,"yyyy-mm"))/B14),"-")
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open DASHBOARD
2. Check B16 (CAC) - should show number or "-" (not #ERROR!)
3. Go to Settings & Budget
4. Enter marketing budget for current month (e.g., 2024-10, $3000)
5. Add 10 new members
6. Verify CAC = $3000 / 10 = $300

---

### Phase 4: Source Analysis Spend Column (HIGH)
**Line:** 969  
**Issue:** Not filtering by date range - summed ALL months for each source  
**Fix:** Added date range filtering using TEXT(...,"yyyy-mm") format matching

**Before:**
```javascript
ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A20:A30="","",SUMIFS('Settings & Budget'!$E$44:$E$67,'Settings & Budget'!$B$44:$B$67,A20:A30)))
```

**After:**
```javascript
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A20:A30="","",SUMIFS('Settings & Budget'!C44:C67,'Settings & Budget'!B44:B67,A20:A30,'Settings & Budget'!A44:A67,">="&TEXT('Settings & Budget'!B30,"yyyy-mm"),'Settings & Budget'!A44:A67,"<="&TEXT('Settings & Budget'!B31,"yyyy-mm"))))
```

**Changes:**
- Uses C44:C67 (Monthly Budget column) instead of E44:E67 (Daily Rate)
- Filters by B44:B67 (Source column)
- Filters by A44:A67 (Month column) to match date range

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open Settings & Budget
2. Enter budget for "Paid Search" - Oct 2024 - $2000
3. Enter budget for "Paid Search" - Sep 2024 - $1500
4. Go to DASHBOARD
5. Set date range to "Last 30 Days" (should include Oct only)
6. Verify G20 (Paid Search row) shows $2000
7. Set date range to "Last 90 Days" (should include Sep + Oct)
8. Verify G20 shows $3500

---

### Phase 5: Source Analysis CAC Column (HIGH)
**Line:** 979  
**Issue:** Variable naming might have caused scoping issues  
**Fix:** Renamed `members` to `newMembers` for clarity

**Before:**
```javascript
LET(spend,G20:G30,members,COUNTIFS(...),IF(spend=0,"Organic",IF(members=0,"-",spend/members)))
```

**After:**
```javascript
LET(spend,G20:G30,newMembers,COUNTIFS(...),IF(spend=0,"Organic",IF(newMembers=0,"-",spend/newMembers)))
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open DASHBOARD
2. Check K20 (CAC column in Source Analysis)
3. Sources with $0 spend should show "Organic"
4. Sources with spend but no members should show "-"
5. Sources with spend and members should show $ value

---

### Phase 6: Source Analysis LTV Column (MEDIUM)
**Line:** 983  
**Issue:** INDEX/MATCH not compatible with ARRAYFORMULA  
**Fix:** Changed to VLOOKUP

**Before:**
```javascript
IFERROR(INDEX('_LTV Calculations'!T:T, MATCH(A20:A30, '_LTV Calculations'!N:N, 0)), 0)
```

**After:**
```javascript
IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A20:A30,'_LTV Calculations'!N3:T11,7,FALSE),0)
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. Add 5 members from "Paid Search"
2. Wait for _LTV Calculations to compute
3. Check DASHBOARD L20 (LTV for Paid Search)
4. Should show dollar value (not 0)
5. Should match _LTV Calculations "Avg LTV" for that source

---

### Phase 7: Source Analysis CPL, CPA, CPS (MEDIUM)
**Lines:** 974-976  
**Issue:** Division might produce decimals, needed rounding  
**Fix:** Added ROUND(..., 0) to ensure whole dollar amounts

**Before:**
```javascript
G20:G30/B20:B30  // Could show $123.456789
```

**After:**
```javascript
ROUND(G20:G30/B20:B30,0)  // Shows $123
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open DASHBOARD
2. Check H20 (CPL) = Spend / Leads - should show whole dollars
3. Check I20 (CPA) = Spend / Appts - should show whole dollars
4. Check J20 (CPS) = Spend / Shows - should show whole dollars
5. Verify calculations are correct

---

### Phase 8: LTV Analysis Tab (MEDIUM)
**Lines:** 1095-1134  
**Issue:** None - formulas already correct  
**Status:** VERIFIED - No changes needed

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open LTV Analysis tab
2. Verify row 4 shows data (not blank)
3. Should show sources with member counts
4. No #REF! errors anywhere
5. Churn rate and cohort sections should populate

---

### Phase 9: UTM Data for Sample Leads (CRITICAL FIX)
**Lines:** 2104-2132, 2154  
**Issue:** Sample leads didn't populate _UTM Tracking, so Source formula couldn't look up source  
**Fix:** 
1. Set Source (column H) directly in sample lead data
2. Also populate _UTM Tracking with matching rows

**Added Code:**
- New UTM data generation (15 columns)
- Inserts UTM rows when sample leads are added
- Final Source column (O) matches what Lead Data H2 formula looks up

**Testing Steps:**
1. Click "Gym Ops â†’ Add 20 Sample Leads"
2. Check Lead Data column H (Source) - should show source names (not "Not Tracked")
3. Unhide _UTM Tracking tab
4. Verify 20 rows were added
5. Check column O (Final Source) matches Lead Data column H

---

### Phase 10: New Revenue by Membership Type Section (NEW FEATURE)
**Lines:** 1080-1112  
**Issue:** Section was missing from DASHBOARD  
**Fix:** Added new section showing revenue breakdown by membership type

**Features:**
- Shows New Members count by type
- Shows New MRR total by type
- Shows Average MRR per member
- Shows % of total new revenue

**Formula Logic:**
```javascript
// New Members
COUNTIFS('Lead Data'!U:U,type,'Lead Data'!T:T,date_range,'Lead Data'!S:S,TRUE)

// New MRR
SUMIFS('Lead Data'!V:V,'Lead Data'!U:U,type,'Lead Data'!T:T,date_range,'Lead Data'!S:S,TRUE)

// Avg MRR
New MRR / New Members

// % of Total
New MRR for this type / Total New MRR across all types
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. Open DASHBOARD
2. Scroll to row 70
3. Verify section header exists
4. Add 3 PT members ($200 MRR each)
5. Add 2 General members ($150 MRR each)
6. Verify:
   - PT: 3 members, $600 MRR, $200 avg, 66.7% of total
   - General: 2 members, $300 MRR, $150 avg, 33.3% of total

## What Each Fix Does

### 1. Trial End (R2)
**Purpose:** Auto-calculates when member's trial expires  
**Formula:** Trial Start Date + Trial Length (from Settings B33)  
**Example:** Trial starts Oct 1 + 14 days = Trial ends Oct 15

### 2. Dashboard CAC (B16)
**Purpose:** Shows average cost to acquire one member  
**Formula:** Total Marketing Spend (in date range) / New Members (in date range)  
**Example:** Spent $3000, got 10 members = $300 CAC

### 3. Source Spend (G20)
**Purpose:** Shows total marketing spend by source in date range  
**Formula:** SUMIFS marketing budget matching source AND month range  
**Example:** Paid Search spent $2000 in Sep + $3000 in Oct = $5000 (if range is 90 days)

### 4. Source CAC (K20)
**Purpose:** CAC broken down by marketing source  
**Formula:** Spend for this source / New members from this source  
**Example:** Paid Search spent $5000, got 10 members = $500 CAC

### 5. Source LTV (L20)
**Purpose:** Average lifetime value of members from each source  
**Formula:** VLOOKUP from _LTV Calculations tab  
**Example:** Paid Search members stay 18 months avg, pay $150/mo = $2700 LTV

### 6. CPL/CPA/CPS (H20, I20, J20)
**Purpose:** Cost efficiency metrics  
**Formula:** Spend / Count  
**Example:** 
- CPL: $5000 / 100 leads = $50 per lead
- CPA: $5000 / 60 appts = $83 per appointment
- CPS: $5000 / 42 shows = $119 per show

### 7. New Revenue by Type (Rows 72-75)
**Purpose:** See which membership types are generating the most new revenue  
**Shows:** 
- How many new PT vs General vs Small Group members
- Total MRR from each type
- Which type is most popular

---

## Known Issues (Intentional)

### 1. HOT Leads Not Working
**Status:** Removed from plan  
**Reason:** Lead Score column (AD) formula just shows "Lead" - not a priority feature  
**Workaround:** Use Action Items section instead

### 2. Hidden Tabs Still Exist
**Status:** Kept for now  
**Reason:** Some are needed (_LTV Calculations, _Metrics, _UTM Tracking)  
**Future:** Can remove _Data, _Chart Data, _Daily Spend if truly unused

### 3. Import Members Not Tested
**Status:** Low priority  
**Reason:** Most users won't have historical data to import  
**Testing:** Manual only if needed

---

## If Something Still Doesn't Work

### Systematic Debugging:

**Step 1:** Identify which phase is failing  
**Step 2:** Check the specific formula in that cell  
**Step 3:** Report to me:
- Phase number
- Cell reference (e.g., "DASHBOARD G20")
- Error message or unexpected value
- Screenshot if helpful

**Step 4:** I'll provide a targeted fix for that specific issue
