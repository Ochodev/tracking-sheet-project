  LEAD_DATA: { ... },   // 28 constants
  LTV_CALCULATIONS: { ... },  // 6 constants
  MEMBERS: { ... },     // 2 constants
  METRICS: { ... }      // 2 constants
});
```

function runHealthCheck() {
  // 6 comprehensive test categories
  // Detailed pass/fail/warning reporting
  // Actionable recommendations
}
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Before Documentation System

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 60+ scattered MD files | Hard to find relevant info |
| Hard-coded cell references | Changes caused cascading failures |
| No systematic testing | Bugs reached production |
| No change tracking | Couldn't trace what broke |
| No troubleshooting guide | Spent hours debugging |

### After Documentation System

| Solution | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| 6 core docs (single source of truth) | Find info in <2 minutes |
| CELL_REFS constants | Change once, update everywhere |
| Automated + manual test suites | Catch bugs before deploy |
| CHANGES.md with templates | Track every modification |
| TROUBLESHOOTING.md with solutions | Fix issues in <10 minutes |
