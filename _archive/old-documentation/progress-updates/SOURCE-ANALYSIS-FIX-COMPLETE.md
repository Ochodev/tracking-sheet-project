# SOURCE ANALYSIS Fix Complete ✅

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Issue:** 7 columns in SOURCE ANALYSIS (Dashboard rows 18-30) showing 0 or blank values  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## Broken Columns

The following columns were broken:
- **Spend (G)** - Showing $0
- **CPL (H)** - Showing blank/0 (depends on Spend)
- **CPA (I)** - Showing blank/0 (depends on Spend)
- **CPS (J)** - Showing blank/0 (depends on Spend)
- **CAC (K)** - Showing blank/0 (depends on Spend)
- **LTV (L)** - Showing 0
- **LTV:CAC (M)** - Showing blank (depends on LTV and CAC)

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Spend Formula (Column G)

**In GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs (line 971):**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
SUMIFS('Settings & Budget'!$E$44:$E$67,'Settings & Budget'!$B$44:$B$67,A20:A30)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Row range 44:67 - too narrow (Marketing Budget starts at row 40, goes to 100)
- ❌ No date range filtering - summed ALL months instead of selected window
- ✅ Column E correct (Daily Rate)

**In GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs (line 964):**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
SUMIFS('Settings & Budget'!C44:C67,'Settings & Budget'!B44:B67,A20:A30,...)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Column C is Monthly Budget (should be E for Daily Rate)
- ❌ Row range 44:67 - too narrow
- ✅ Had date range filtering logic (but wrong columns)

### Issue 2: LTV Formula (Column L)

**Both files (lines 986 & 978):**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
INDEX('_LTV Calculations'!T:T, MATCH(A20:A30, '_LTV Calculations'!N:N, 0))
```

**Problem:**
- ❌ INDEX/MATCH doesn't work properly within ARRAYFORMULA
- Need VLOOKUP instead

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Spend Formula ✅

**New formula (both files):**
```javascript
=ARRAYFORMULA(MAP(A20:A30,
  LAMBDA(src,
    IF(src="","",
      LET(
        startDate,'Settings & Budget'!$B$30,
        endDate,'Settings & Budget'!$B$31,
        rawMonths,'Settings & Budget'!$A$40:$A$100,
        sources,'Settings & Budget'!$B$40:$B$100,
        rates,'Settings & Budget'!$E$40:$E$100,
        monthStarts,ARRAYFORMULA(IF(rawMonths="",,IF(ISNUMBER(rawMonths),DATE(YEAR(rawMonths),MONTH(rawMonths),1),DATE(VALUE(LEFT(rawMonths,4)),VALUE(MID(rawMonths,6,2)),1)))),
        monthEnds,ARRAYFORMULA(IF(monthStarts="",,EOMONTH(monthStarts,0))),
        valid,(sources=src)*(rates<>"")*(monthStarts<>"")*(monthEnds>=startDate)*(monthStarts<=endDate),
        IF(SUM(valid)=0,0,
          SUM(MAP(FILTER(monthStarts,valid),FILTER(monthEnds,valid),FILTER(rates,valid),
            LAMBDA(mStart,mEnd,rate,
              LET(overlapStart,MAX(mStart,startDate),overlapEnd,MIN(mEnd,endDate),days,MAX(0,overlapEnd-overlapStart+1),days*rate)
            )
          ))
        )
      )
    )
  )
))
```

**What this does:**
1. ✅ Uses correct row range (40:100)
2. ✅ Uses correct column (E for Daily Rate)
3. ✅ Filters by date range with proper overlap calculation
4. ✅ Handles partial month overlaps correctly
5. ✅ Returns 0 for sources with no budget data

### Fix 2: LTV Formula ✅

**New formula (both files):**
```javascript
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A20:A30="","",IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A20:A30,'_LTV Calculations'!N:T,7,FALSE),0)))
```

**What this does:**
1. ✅ Uses VLOOKUP instead of INDEX/MATCH
2. ✅ Works properly within ARRAYFORMULA
3. ✅ Returns 0 for sources not in LTV Calculations
4. ✅ Looks up column 7 (column T) from range N:T

## Files Updated

1. ✅ **GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs**
   - Line 970-992: Fixed Spend formula
   - Line 1007: Fixed LTV formula

2. ✅ **GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs**
   - Line 964-986: Fixed Spend formula  
   - Line 1000: Fixed LTV formula

3. ✅ **Code.gs** - Verified (different section layout, no changes needed)

## Expected Results

Once you redeploy the updated script:

### Spend Column (G)
- Shows actual dollar amounts based on Marketing Budget table
- Filters by date range (Start Date to End Date from Settings)
- Calculates daily spend × days in overlap period
- Example: `$3,450`, `$1,200`, etc.

### CPL, CPA, CPS Columns (H, I, J)
- Automatically calculate correctly (they reference G20:G30)
- Show "Organic" when Spend = $0
- Show "-" when denominator = 0
- Show cost values when data exists

### CAC Column (K)
- Calculates Spend / New Members
- Shows "Organic" when Spend = $0
- Shows "-" when no members
- Shows cost per acquisition when data exists

### LTV Column (L)
- Pulls values from `_LTV Calculations` tab
- Shows lifetime value per source
- Shows $0 for sources not in LTV table

### LTV:CAC Column (M)
- Calculates LTV / CAC ratio
- Shows format like "3.5x", "2.1x"
- Shows "-" when either value is 0 or missing
- Shows "-" for Organic sources

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Open your Google Sheet**
2. **Extensions → Apps Script**
3. **Copy content from one of these files:**
   - `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs` (recommended)
   - `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE-SAFE.gs` (alternative)
4. **Paste into Apps Script editor** (replace all existing code)
5. **Save** (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
6. **Close Apps Script editor**
7. **Refresh your Google Sheet**
8. **Run:** Gym Ops → Initialize Template
9. **Verify:** Dashboard SOURCE ANALYSIS section shows data

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify these calculations:

- [ ] Spend column shows dollar amounts (not $0)
- [ ] CPL = Spend / Leads
- [ ] CPA = Spend / Appointments
- [ ] CPS = Spend / Showed
- [ ] CAC = Spend / New Members
- [ ] LTV column shows values (or $0 if not in LTV table)
- [ ] LTV:CAC shows ratios (e.g., "3.5x")
- [ ] "Organic" displays for sources with $0 spend
- [ ] "-" displays when calculations not possible (0 denominator)

## Technical Notes

### Why MAP/LAMBDA?
- Required for date range overlap calculations
- SUMIFS can't handle partial month overlaps
- Each source needs independent calculation across multiple months

### Why VLOOKUP instead of INDEX/MATCH?
- INDEX/MATCH doesn't array-expand properly in ARRAYFORMULA
- VLOOKUP works seamlessly with ARRAYFORMULA
- Simpler and more reliable for this use case

### Marketing Budget Table Structure
```
Row 39: Headers (Month | Source | Monthly Budget | Days | Daily Rate)
Row 40-100: Data
Column A: Month (YYYY-MM format)
Column B: Source name
Column C: Monthly Budget ($)
Column D: Days in Month (auto-calculated)
Column E: Daily Rate ($) - used in Spend calculation
```
