## How to Report Issues

**Good Report:**
```
Phase 4 failed
Cell: DASHBOARD G20
Shows: 0
Expected: $3000
Note: I entered budget in Settings B44 = $3000
```

**Bad Report:**
```
Dashboard broken
```

**Good reports** get 5-minute fixes.  
**Bad reports** require 20 minutes of back-and-forth.

---

## Rollback Plan

If everything fails catastrophically:

1. Don't panic
2. Find your last working backup
3. Restore it
4. Report to me what broke
5. I'll provide more conservative fix

**Better yet:** Test phase-by-phase so you know exactly what broke

---

## Final Notes

### What I Did Differently This Time

1. **Listened to you** - You said incremental approach, I did incremental
2. **Kept it simple** - No fancy formulas, just basic ones that work
3. **Provided testing plan** - You can verify each fix
4. **Honest risk assessment** - I told you what might still break
5. **Committed to iteration** - We'll fix together until it works

### What I'm NOT Claiming

- ‚ùå "Everything will work perfectly"
- ‚ùå "This is production-ready"
- ‚ùå "No more fixes needed"

### What I AM Claiming

- ‚úÖ "I fixed 10 specific issues"
- ‚úÖ "Each fix is testable independently"
- ‚úÖ "I simplified complex formulas"
- ‚úÖ "I'm ready to debug failures with you"
