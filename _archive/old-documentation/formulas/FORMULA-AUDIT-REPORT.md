# FORMULA AUDIT REPORT
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Sheet:** test gym - Gym Ops  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This audit identified **critical formula errors** across the DASHBOARD and LTV Analysis tabs caused by incorrect cell references pulling header text instead of actual values. The root cause is that formulas reference row 2 in Settings & Budget (which contains headers like "Target") instead of the corresponding data rows (3-11).

### Key Findings:
1. **13 cells** with #VALUE! errors on DASHBOARD tab
2. **24+ cells** with #REF! errors on LTV Analysis tab  
3. **1 critical misalignment** in Target column (C10-C16)
4. **0 actual data loss** - all data intact, formulas need correction

---

## ISSUE #1: TARGET COLUMN SHOWING "TARGET" TEXT INSTEAD OF VALUES

### Location
**DASHBOARD Tab:** Cells C10-C16 (Target column in KEY METRICS section)

### Current State
- **Cell C10 (Leads Target):** Shows "Target" (should show 70)
- **Cell C11 (Set % Target):** Shows "Target" (should show 60.0%)
- **Cell C12 (Show % Target):** Shows "Target" (should show 70.0%)
- **Cell C13 (Close % Target):** Shows "Target" (should show 50.0%)
- **Cell C14 (New Members Target):** Shows "Target" (should show 20)
- **Cell C15 (MRR Target):** Shows "Target" (should show $3,000)
- **Cell C16 (CAC Target):** Shows "Target" (should show $150)

### Current Formula (Example: C10)
```
=IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B2,"⚠️ Setup")
```

### Root Cause
Formula references **B2** (header row) instead of **B3** (actual Leads target value).

### Impact
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Cascade Effect:** YES - causes #VALUE! errors in columns D, E, F
- **User Experience:** Confusing display, metrics appear broken
- **Data Integrity:** No data loss, display issue only

---

### SOLUTION ANGLES FOR ISSUE #1

#### **Angle 1: Direct Cell Reference Correction** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Approach:** Update each formula to reference the correct data row instead of header row.

**Implementation:**
```
C10: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B3,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B3
C11: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B4,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B4
C12: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B5,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B5
C13: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B6,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B6
C14: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B7,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B7
C15: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B8,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B8
C16: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B9,"⚠️ Setup")  // B2 → B9
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, direct fix
- Minimal changes required
- Easy to verify
- No risk to other formulas

**Cons:**
- Requires manual update to each cell
- If row structure changes in Settings & Budget, breaks again
- Doesn't address root cause of design pattern

**Stability Score:** 8/10  
**Implementation Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk Level:** LOW

---

#### **Angle 2: Named Range Approach**
**Approach:** Create named ranges for each target metric, making formulas more maintainable and self-documenting.

**Implementation:**
1. Create named ranges in Settings & Budget:
   - `Target_Leads` → B3
   - `Target_SetRate` → B4
   - `Target_ShowRate` → B5
   - `Target_CloseRate` → B6
   - `Target_NewMembers` → B7
   - `Target_MRR` → B8
   - `Target_CAC` → B9

2. Update formulas:
```
C10: =IFERROR(Target_Leads,"⚠️ Setup")
C11: =IFERROR(Target_SetRate,"⚠️ Setup")
C12: =IFERROR(Target_ShowRate,"⚠️ Setup")
C13: =IFERROR(Target_CloseRate,"⚠️ Setup")
C14: =IFERROR(Target_NewMembers,"⚠️ Setup")
C15: =IFERROR(Target_MRR,"⚠️ Setup")
C16: =IFERROR(Target_CAC,"⚠️ Setup")
```

**Pros:**

- More complex to debug

**Stability Score:** 7/10  
**Implementation Time:** 10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

---

#### **Angle 5: Helper Column with VLOOKUP**
**Approach:** Create a hidden helper column that uses VLOOKUP to map metrics to targets.

**Implementation:**
1. Add hidden column between A and B on DASHBOARD
2. Use VLOOKUP to fetch values:
```
New Column: =VLOOKUP(A10,'Settings & Budget'!A:B,2,FALSE)
C10: =IFERROR(B10,"⚠️ Setup")  // Reference helper column
```

**Pros:**
- Separates lookup logic from display
- Easy to debug (can unhide helper column)
- Consistent pattern across all rows

**Cons:**
- Adds clutter (even if hidden)
- Extra column to maintain
- User might accidentally unhide/delete it

**Stability Score:** 8/10  
**Implementation Time:** 15 minutes  
**Risk Level:** LOW

---

#### **Angle 6: Apps Script Custom Function**
**Approach:** Create a custom function that intelligently fetches target values.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
/**
 * Gets target value for a metric
 * @param {string} metricName The name of the metric
 * @return {number} The target value
 */
function getTarget(metricName) {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var settingsSheet = ss.getSheetByName('Settings & Budget');
  var data = settingsSheet.getRange('A:B').getValues();
  
  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    if (data[i][0] === metricName) {
      return data[i][1];
    }
  }
  return "⚠️ Setup";
}
```

Formula:
```
C10: =getTarget(A10)
```

2. Check for "Cancelled" or "Inactive" status
3. Count how many cancelled members exist
4. If zero, "No Data" is accurate
5. If >0, formulas need fixing

**Pros:**
- Determines if this is data issue or formula issue
- Quick validation
- No changes if data doesn't exist

**Cons:**
- Doesn't fix if it's a formula problem

**Stability Score:** N/A (diagnostic)  
**Implementation Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk Level:** NONE

---

#### **Angle 2: Update Churn Calculation Formula**
**Approach:** Implement proper churn rate calculation.

**Implementation:**
```
// Monthly Churn Rate
= COUNTIFS(Members!Status,"Cancelled", Members!CancelDate,">="&StartOfMonth, Members!CancelDate,"<="&EndOfMonth) 
  / COUNTIFS(Members!Status,"Active", Members!StartDate,"<"&StartOfMonth)
```

Or for package-specific:
```
=COUNTIFS(Members!Status,"Cancelled", Members!Package,"PT") 
 / COUNTIFS(Members!Package,"PT")
```

**Pros:**
- Accurate churn calculation
- Can be customized by time period
- Industry-standard formula

**Cons:**
- Requires cancelled date data
- Need to identify correct columns
- More complex formula

**Stability Score:** 9/10  
**Implementation Time:** 30 minutes  
**Risk Level:** LOW

---

#### **Angle 3: Show Interim Metrics**
**Approach:** Display component metrics even if churn can't be calculated.

**Implementation:**
```
// Instead of just "No Data", show:
="Active: " & COUNTIFS(Members!Package,"PT",Members!Status,"Active") & 
 " | Cancelled: " & COUNTIFS(Members!Package,"PT",Members!Status,"Cancelled")
```

**Pros:**
- More informative
- Helps users understand why no churn rate
- Shows data is being tracked

**Cons:**
- Not a calculation
- Less useful for analysis
- String format not numerical

**Stability Score:** 7/10  
**Implementation Time:** 15 minutes  
**Risk Level:** LOW

---

#### **Angle 4: Use Projected Churn from Settings**
**Approach:** Fall back to expected churn rate from Settings & Budget when actual data insufficient.

**Implementation:**
```
=IF(ActualChurnData < MinimumSample, 
  'Settings & Budget'!ExpectedChurn&" (projected)",
  ActualChurnRate)
```

**Pros:**
- Always shows a value
- Clearly marks projected vs actual
- Useful for new businesses

**Cons:**
- Mixes projected and actual data
- Could be misleading
- Need to define "sufficient sample"

**Stability Score:** 7/10  
**Implementation Time:** 20 minutes  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

## STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

### High-Risk Areas to Monitor
1. **Settings & Budget structure** - Many formulas depend on specific row positions
2. **Date Range System** - Used across multiple calculations
3. **Member Status tracking** - Critical for LTV calculations

### Recommendations for Long-Term Stability

#### 1. Use Named Ranges
Convert frequently-referenced cells to named ranges:
- `DateRangeStart` instead of 'Settings & Budget'!B30
- `DateRangeEnd` instead of 'Settings & Budget'!B31
- `Target_[Metric]` for each target value

#### 2. Add Data Validation
- Restrict Status column to predefined values
- Validate date formats
- Ensure required fields are filled

#### 3. Document Formula Logic
Add comments or a "Formula Guide" tab explaining:
- What each complex formula calculates
- Dependencies between tabs
- Expected data formats

#### 4. Implement Error Alerts
Create a "Health Check" section on DASHBOARD:
```
=IF(COUNTIF(Dashboard,"#VALUE!")>0,"⚠️ Formula Errors Detected","✅ All Systems Normal")
```

#### 5. Lock Critical Cells
Protect cells containing formulas to prevent accidental editing:
- Right-click → Protect range
- Allow specific users to edit
- Lock all formula cells by default

#### 6. Version Control Comments
Use cell notes to track major formula changes:
- Right-click → Insert note
- Document date, reason, and who changed it

## APPENDIX A: FORMULA REFERENCE

### Current Formulas (Problematic)

**C10 (Leads Target):**
```
=IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B2,"⚠️ Setup")
```
❌ Problem: References header row (B2) instead of data (B3)

**D10 (Goal To Date):**
```
=IF(C10="","",C10*(MAX(0,MIN('Settings & Budget'!B31,TODAY())-'Settings & Budget'!B30+1))/(MAX(1,'Settings & Budget'!B31-'Settings & Budget'!B30+1)))
```
❌ Problem: C10 contains text "Target", causes #VALUE! in multiplication

**E10 (Variance):**
```
=IF(D15="","",B15-D15)
```
❌ Problem: D15 has #VALUE! error, propagates to E15

---

### Proposed Formulas (Fixed)

**C10 (Leads Target) - FIXED:**
```
=IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B3,"⚠️ Setup")
```
✅ Solution: Reference B3 (data) instead of B2 (header)

**C11-C16 (Other Targets) - FIXED:**
```
C11: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B4,"⚠️ Setup")
C12: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B5,"⚠️ Setup")
C13: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B6,"⚠️ Setup")
C14: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B7,"⚠️ Setup")
C15: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B8,"⚠️ Setup")
C16: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B9,"⚠️ Setup")
```
✅ Solution: Each references correct row for its metric

## APPENDIX D: FORMULA COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

### Simple Formulas (Low Risk to Modify)
- Target references (C10-C16): Single cell reference with error wrapper
- Variance (E10-E16): Simple subtraction
- Basic counts/averages

### Medium Complexity (Moderate Risk)
- Goal To Date (D10-D16): Date-based progress calculation
- Status indicators: Conditional logic with thresholds
- COUNTIFS with multiple criteria

### High Complexity (High Risk - Be Careful)
- ARRAYFORMULA calculations: Affects multiple cells at once
- Cross-sheet FILTER functions: Dependencies across tabs
- Nested IF with IFERROR chains: Hard to debug

### Very High Complexity (Expert Level)
- LTV calculations: Multiple data sources, time periods
- Cohort analysis: Array formulas with date cohorts
- Dynamic reference ranges: INDIRECT or complex OFFSET

---

## CONCLUSION

The sheet has **solid underlying architecture** with **systematic formula errors** caused by incorrect row references. The good news:

✅ **No data loss** - all source data is intact  
✅ **Formulas are logically sound** - just pointing to wrong cells  
✅ **Cascade fixes** - fixing root issues automatically resolves downstream  
✅ **Quick wins available** - Phase 1 fixes in under 30 minutes  

### Critical Path:
1. Fix C10-C16 (5 minutes) → Unlocks Issues #2, #3, #4
2. Investigate LTV #REF! errors (60-90 minutes) → Unlocks Issues #6, #7
3. Enhance stability with named ranges (optional but recommended)

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Zero #VALUE! errors on DASHBOARD
- [ ] Zero #REF! errors on LTV Analysis
- [ ] All metrics display actual values, not "Target" text
- [ ] LTV calculations show non-zero values
- [ ] Churn rates calculate (or clearly indicate insufficient data)

**Estimated Total Fix Time:** 2-4 hours depending on LTV complexity
