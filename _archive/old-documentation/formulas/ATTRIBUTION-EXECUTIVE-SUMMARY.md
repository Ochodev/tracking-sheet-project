## 🔴 TOP 5 CRITICAL ISSUES (Explained for Non-Technical Audience)

### Issue #1: CAC Attribution is Off ⚠️

**What It Means:**  
The system calculates "Cost per Customer" (CAC) by comparing how much you spent this month vs how many people joined this month. But people who join this month might have been leads from last month's marketing spend.

**Real Example:**
```
October: Spend $1,000 on Facebook ads
        Result: 0 members joined
        System says: "Warning - spending money but no conversions"

November: Spend $0
         Result: 10 members joined (from October's ads)
         System says: CAC = $0 (FREE customers!)

Reality: CAC = $1,000 ÷ 10 = $100 per member
```

**Why It Matters:**  
You might think a marketing channel is failing (October) when it's actually working, or think it's free (November) when you actually paid for it.

**Business Impact:**
- Incorrect budget allocation decisions
- May cut working campaigns too early
- May overspend on "free" channels that aren't really free

**Fix Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Fix Complexity:** Medium (requires tracking lead creation date → member conversion)

---

### Issue #2: Multi-Location Gyms Get Wrong Attribution 🏢

**What It Means:**  
If you have multiple gym locations and the same person inquires at both, the system only tracks the first location's source.

**Real Example:**
```
Downtown Location:
- Lead inquires from Facebook ad
- System records: Source = Facebook

Suburbs Location:
- Same person inquires from Google ad
- System ignores this (duplicate Lead ID)

Result: Suburbs Google ad credited to Facebook
```

**Why It Matters:**  
If you're expanding to multiple locations, you can't trust which marketing channels work for which location.

**Business Impact:**
- Can't compare marketing effectiveness by location
- Budget allocation between locations is guesswork
- May cut successful location-specific campaigns

**Fix Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Fix Complexity:** Medium (add Location to tracking system)

**Who It Affects:** Multi-location gym chains only

---

### Issue #3: System Stops Auto-Calculating at 5,000 Rows 📊

**What It Means:**  
The system is advertised to handle 50,000+ leads, but after 5,000 rows, auto-calculated columns go blank.

**Real Example:**
```
After 5 years of operation:
- You have 5,200 total leads
- Rows 1-5,000: Everything works perfectly
- Rows 5,001-5,200: Source, Status, Lead Score all blank

Dashboard shows: Incomplete counts (missing 200 leads)
Staff don't realize: New leads aren't being tracked
```

**Why It Matters:**  
Your metrics become inaccurate over time and nobody notices until months later.

**Business Impact:**
- Understated lead counts
- Inaccurate conversion rates
- Missing revenue in projections
- Staff confusion

**Fix Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Fix Complexity:** Low (increase limit + add warning)

**Who It Affects:** High-volume gyms (100+ leads/month for 50+ months)

---

### Issue #4: Trial End Dates Can Be Off By One Day ⏰

**What It Means:**  
Due to timezone math, trial end dates might calculate to the day before or after they should.

**Real Example:**
```
Member starts trial: October 1st
14-day trial should end: October 15th
System calculates: October 14th (due to daylight saving time)

Result:
- "Trial ending soon" alert fires wrong day
- Staff call a day early
- Member confused: "I thought I had until tomorrow?"
```

**Why It Matters:**  
Operational confusion, staff waste time, member experience suffers.

**Business Impact:**
- Poor customer experience
- Staff inefficiency
- Inaccurate trial conversion metrics

**Fix Time:** 1 hour  
**Fix Complexity:** Low (simple formula change)

---

### Issue #5: LTV Assumes Fixed Pricing 💰

**What It Means:**  
The system calculates Lifetime Value (LTV) as: Monthly Price × Months Active. It doesn't account for price changes (upgrades/downgrades).

**Real Example:**
```
Member: John Smith
- Joins at $100/month (PT package)
- After 6 months: Upgrades to $200/month (PT + Nutrition)
- Stays total 12 months

System calculates: LTV = $100 × 12 = $1,200
Reality: LTV = ($100 × 6) + ($200 × 6) = $1,800

Error: 33% underestimate
```

**Why It Matters:**  
If you have upsell programs, your actual customer value is higher than reported. This affects:
- How much you should spend on acquisition
- Pricing strategy decisions
- Growth projections

**Business Impact:**
- May underspend on marketing (thinking customers worth less)
- Undervalues upsell programs
- LTV:CAC ratios misleading

**Fix Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Fix Complexity:** High (requires MRR history tracking)

**Short-term Workaround:** Manually adjust LTV for members with upgrades
