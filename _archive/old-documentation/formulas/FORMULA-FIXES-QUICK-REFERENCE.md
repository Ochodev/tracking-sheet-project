## ‚ö° QUICK FIX SUMMARY (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Issue #1: Target Column Fix (C10-C16)
**Problem:** Shows "Target" text instead of values  
**Root Cause:** References row 2 (header) instead of data rows

**COPY THESE FORMULAS:**

```
C10: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B3,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
C11: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B4,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
C12: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B5,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
C13: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B6,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
C14: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B7,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
C15: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B8,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
C16: =IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B9,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")
```

## üéØ 3-STEP FIX PROCESS

### Step 1: Dashboard Targets (5 minutes) ‚≠ê DO THIS FIRST
1. Open DASHBOARD tab
2. Click cell C10
3. Copy formula: `=IFERROR('Settings & Budget'!B3,"‚ö†Ô∏è Setup")`
4. Press Enter
5. Repeat for C11-C16 (use formulas from above)
6. **Verify:** All targets show numbers, not "Target"

### Step 2: Verify Auto-Fixes (2 minutes)
1. Check D10-D16: Should show numbers (Goal To Date)
2. Check E10-E16: Should show numbers (Variance)
3. Check F10-F16: Should show status (BEHIND/ON PACE/AHEAD)
4. ‚úÖ If all show properly, Dashboard is FIXED!

### Step 3: LTV Analysis Deep Dive (1-3 hours)
1. Open LTV Analysis tab
2. Check for hidden tabs (right-click any tab ‚Üí "Unhide")
3. Click cell with #REF! error
4. View formula bar to see what was referenced
5. Use File ‚Üí Version History to see when it broke
6. Repair or rebuild broken formulas

## üîç WHAT EACH ERROR MEANS

### #VALUE!
**What it means:** Formula is trying to do math on text  
**Example:** `=10 * "Target"` ‚Üí Can't multiply by text  
**Fix:** Make sure referenced cell contains a number

### #REF!
**What it means:** Formula references something that was deleted  
**Example:** `=Sheet2!A1` but Sheet2 was deleted  
**Fix:** Restore deleted item OR update formula to new reference

### #N/A
**What it means:** Lookup can't find the value  
**Example:** `=VLOOKUP("John", A:B, 2, FALSE)` but "John" doesn't exist  
**Fix:** Check spelling, check data exists

### #NAME?
**What it means:** Formula uses name that doesn't exist  
**Example:** `=SUM(MyRange)` but MyRange not defined  
**Fix:** Define named range OR use cell reference instead

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### After fixing C10-C16, still seeing errors?

**Check 1:** Did you hit Enter after pasting each formula?  
**Check 2:** Are Settings & Budget values actually in B3-B9?  
**Check 3:** Try clicking D10 and pressing Ctrl+Shift+F9 (force recalculate)

### How do I know if formula is correct?

1. Click the cell
2. Look at formula bar at top
3. Should match formula from this guide
4. Cell should show number, not error

### What if I accidentally break something?

1. File ‚Üí Version History
2. Click timestamp before your changes
3. Click "Restore this version"
4. Try again carefully

## üìû FORMULA SUPPORT MATRIX

| If you see... | It means... | Quick fix... |
|---|---|---|
| "Target" in Target column | Wrong row reference | Use formulas from this guide |
| #VALUE! everywhere | Text in calculation | Fix Target column first |
| #REF! in formula bar | Deleted sheet/range | Check version history |
| #N/A | Lookup failed | Check criteria match data |
| Numbers look wrong | Formula logic issue | Verify calculation method |
| Sheet is slow | Too many formulas recalculating | Consider ARRAYFORMULA |

## üéì LEARN FROM THIS

### Why did this happen?

**Root Cause:** Formula referenced header row instead of data row

**How it happened:**
1. Someone created C10 formula: `='Settings & Budget'!B2`
2. They meant to reference the data row (B3) but used header row (B2)
3. B2 contains text "Target"
4. Formula pulled "Target" text instead of number
5. All downstream formulas failed because they expected numbers

**Prevention:**
1. Use named ranges instead of cell references
2. Lock header rows to prevent accidental changes
3. Add data validation
4. Test formulas after creating them
5. Document formula logic

### Formula Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use named ranges for important cells
- Add IFERROR for graceful failures
- Comment complex formulas
- Test with sample data
- Lock formula cells from editing

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Hardcode row numbers when possible
- Create long formula chains without validation
- Forget to test edge cases
- Leave formulas unprotected
- Skip documentation
