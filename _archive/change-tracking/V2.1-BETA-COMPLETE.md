## 📈 Source Analysis Table Metrics

| Column | Metric | Formula Logic |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **A** | Lead Source | From Settings sources list |
| **B** | Leads (window) | COUNTIFS by source + date range |
| **C** | Appointments | COUNTIFS where Appt Set = TRUE |
| **D** | Showed | COUNTIFS where Show = TRUE |
| **E** | Show Rate | Showed ÷ Appointments |
| **F** | Lead→Member Rate | Members ÷ Leads |
| **G** | Spend (window) | SUMIFS from _Daily Spend |
| **H** | CPL | Spend ÷ Leads |
| **I** | CPA (Appt) | Spend ÷ Appointments |
| **J** | CPS (Show) | Spend ÷ Showed |
| **K** | CP/Trial | Spend ÷ Trials Started |
| **L** | CAC | Spend ÷ New Members |

**Color Coding**:
- 🟡 Yellow: Show Rate (conversion quality)
- 🟢 Green: Lead→Member Rate (success metric)
- 🔴 Red: CAC (cost efficiency)

## 🎓 Best Practices

### **Data Entry**
- ✅ Let GHL populate Lead ID, Created Date, Name, Phone, Email, DOB
- ✅ Manually check boxes (Appt Set, Show, Converted, Cancelled) as events happen
- ✅ Fill MRR and Upfront Fee when member converts
- ⚠️ Don't manually edit Source (auto-filled from UTM)
- ⚠️ Don't manually edit Trial End or Current Status (auto-calculated)

### **Marketing Spend**
- ✅ Enter monthly budgets at the start of each month
- ✅ Run "Generate Daily Spend" after entering/updating budgets
- ✅ Be consistent with source names (use Settings dropdown)
- ⚠️ Don't edit _Daily Spend tab manually (auto-generated)

### **Date Ranges**
- ✅ Use "Last 30 Days" for current month-to-date
- ✅ Use "Custom Range" for campaign-specific analysis
- ✅ Use "QTD" or "YTD" for quarterly/annual reviews
- ✅ Change date range to see charts update in real-time

### **Performance**
- ✅ Works smoothly with 10,000+ leads
- ✅ Charts update automatically when data changes
- ✅ Use "Refresh Dashboards" if formulas seem stuck
- ⚠️ Don't add more than 50,000 rows (Google Sheets limit)

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

### **Charts Not Showing**
- **Cause**: Template not initialized or charts failed to create
- **Fix**: Menu → Gym Ops → Initialize Template (will recreate charts)

### **Source Column Empty**
- **Cause**: No matching UTM data in _UTM Tracking tab
- **Fix**: Check that GHL workflow is populating both Lead Data and _UTM Tracking tabs
- **Fallback**: Default value is "Others"

### **CAC Showing $0.00**
- **Cause**: No marketing spend data for that source
- **Fix**: Add monthly budget in Marketing tab → Generate Daily Spend

### **Date Range Not Filtering**
- **Cause**: Date range dropdown not linked properly
- **Fix**: Check that named range "dashboardDateRange" exists in Settings B27

### **Sample Data Not Working**
- **Cause**: Template not initialized yet
- **Fix**: Menu → Gym Ops → Initialize Template first, then add sample data
