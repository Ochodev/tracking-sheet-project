🔗 GOHIGHLEVEL (GHL) INTEGRATION

Complete Setup Guide

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 OVERVIEW

This sheet integrates with GoHighLevel (GHL) to automatically add leads
when they're created in your CRM. Two workflows are needed:

1. UTM Tracking Workflow (tracks source/campaign)
2. Lead Data Workflow (creates the lead row)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 WORKFLOW 1: UTM TRACKING SETUP

Purpose: Captures UTM parameters for source attribution

Steps:
1. In GHL, go to Automation → Workflows
2. Create new workflow: "Add Lead UTM to Tracking Sheet"
3. Trigger: "Contact Created" or "Opportunity Created"
4. Add Action: "Google Sheets - Update Row" or use Webhooks/Zapier

5. Configure Sheet Connection:
   • Sheet ID: [Your Sheet ID from URL]
   • Tab Name: "_UTM Tracking"
   • Method: "Append Row"

6. Field Mapping (10 columns):
   A - Lead ID        → {{contact.id}}
   B - Created Date   → {{contact.date_added}}
   C - UTM Source     → {{contact.utm_source}}
   D - UTM Medium     → {{contact.utm_medium}}
   E - UTM Campaign   → {{contact.utm_campaign}}
   F - UTM Term       → {{contact.utm_term}}
   G - UTM Content    → {{contact.utm_content}}
   H - GCLID          → {{contact.gclid}}
   I - FBCLID         → {{contact.fbclid}}
   J - Referrer       → {{contact.referrer_url}}

7. Save and activate workflow

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 WORKFLOW 2: LEAD DATA SETUP

Purpose: Creates lead row with contact details

Steps:
1. Create new workflow: "Add Lead to Tracking Sheet"
2. Trigger: "Contact Created" (same as Workflow 1)
3. Add Action: "Google Sheets - Update Row" or Webhooks/Zapier
4. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add 5-second delay AFTER Workflow 1
   (ensures UTM data exists before Lead Data references it)

5. Configure Sheet Connection:
   • Sheet ID: [Same as Workflow 1]
   • Tab Name: "Lead Data"
   • Method: "Append Row"

6. Field Mapping (26 columns):
   
   REQUIRED FIELDS:
   A - Lead ID        → {{contact.id}}
   B - Created Date   → {{contact.date_added}}
   C - First Name     → {{contact.first_name}}
   D - Last Name      → {{contact.last_name}}
   E - Phone          → {{contact.phone}}
   F - Email          → {{contact.email}}
   
   OPTIONAL FIELDS:
   G - DOB            → {{contact.date_of_birth}}
   H - Source         → [Leave empty - auto-calculated from UTM]
   I - Campaign       → {{contact.utm_campaign}}
   J - Staff Owner    → {{contact.assigned_to}}
   K - Location       → [Leave empty or use default]
   
   FUNNEL FIELDS (Leave empty - filled manually or by staff):
   L - Appt Set?      → [Empty]
   M - Appt Date      → [Empty]
   N - Show?          → [Empty]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 TESTING YOUR INTEGRATION

Checklist:
1. ✅ Create a test contact in GHL with known UTM parameters
2. ✅ Wait 10 seconds for workflows to complete
3. ✅ Check _UTM Tracking tab → Verify new row with UTMs
4. ✅ Check Lead Data tab → Verify new lead row
5. ✅ Verify Source column (H) auto-populated correctly
6. ✅ Verify name, phone, email populated correctly
7. ✅ Delete test contact from both sheets
8. ✅ Repeat with different sources (Google Ads, Facebook, etc.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

Problem: Source shows "⚠️ Not Tracked"
Solution: Lead exists in Lead Data but not in _UTM Tracking
  • Check if UTM workflow ran successfully
  • Manually add row to _UTM Tracking with Lead ID + UTM Source
  • Or manually select Source from dropdown in column H

Problem: Source shows "⚠️ No UTM"
Solution: Contact has no UTM source in GHL
  • For manual entries, use "CRM UI" source
  • For organic traffic, use "Direct Traffic"
  • Or manually select correct source from dropdown

Problem: Source shows "⚠️ Unmapped"
Solution: UTM source not in mapping table
  • Go to Settings & Budget tab, columns G-H
  • Add new row: [Raw UTM] → [Standardized Source]
  • Example: "google_ads" → "Paid Search"

Problem: Duplicate leads created
Solution: Workflow triggered multiple times
  • Add filter in GHL workflow: "Only if contact is new"
  • Use duplicate detection (enabled by default)
  • Check Lead Data for duplicate warnings in column AD

Problem: Date fields showing errors
Solution: Date format mismatch
  • GHL dates must be in format: YYYY-MM-DD
  • Check contact.date_added format in GHL
  • Use TEXT() formula in GHL to format: TEXT(date, "yyyy-mm-dd")

Problem: Workflow not running
Solution: Connection or permissions issue
  • Verify Google Sheets connected in GHL
  • Check OAuth permissions granted
  • Re-authenticate Google account in GHL
  • Ensure Sheet ID is correct (copy from URL)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 PRO TIPS

1. Use Workflow Delays
   • Add 5-second delay between UTM and Lead workflows
   • Ensures data dependency order

2. Test with Different Sources
   • Google Ads (utm_source=adwords)
   • Facebook Ads (utm_source=fb_ad)
   • Organic (no UTMs)
   • Referrals (utm_source=referral)

3. Monitor First Week Closely
   • Check daily for mapping issues
   • Adjust UTM mapping table as needed
   • Train staff on manual source override

4. Backup Data Regularly
   • Use Gym Ops → Create Backup Now
   • Monthly backups run automatically
   • Keep external copies for safety

5. Keep UTM Parameters Consistent
   • Standardize utm_source values
   • Document your UTM strategy
   • Train marketing team on conventions
