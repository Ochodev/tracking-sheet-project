### **4. Settings Tab - LTV Assumptions** (Added)
**Location**: Column G, rows 16-21

**Table**:
```
Package Type    | Expected Lifespan (months) | Expected Churn Rate (%)
PT              | 12                         | 8.3%
Small Group     | 18                         | 5.6%
General         | 18                         | 5.6%
Class Pack      | 6                          | 16.7%
```

**Purpose**:
- Default assumptions for LTV calculations
- Used for active members (no cancel date yet)
- Customizable based on your gym's historical data
- Churn Rate = 1 ÷ Expected Lifespan × 12

**How to Customize**:
1. Update "Expected Lifespan" if you know your average (e.g., PT members stay 14 months on average)
2. Churn Rate will auto-calculate or you can override
3. These are only used for members who haven't cancelled yet

## 🔢 LTV Calculation Method

### **Formula: Average MRR × Average Customer Lifespan**

As you requested: **Option A**

### **For Cancelled Members:**
```
Actual Lifespan = Cancel Date - Join Date (in months)
Actual LTV = MRR × Actual Lifespan

Example:
  Join Date: Jan 15, 2023
  Cancel Date: Jul 15, 2024
  Lifespan: 18 months
  MRR: $150
  Actual LTV: $150 × 18 = $2,700
```

### **For Active Members:**
```
Predicted Lifespan = Expected Lifespan from Settings (based on package)
Predicted LTV = MRR × Predicted Lifespan

Example:
  Join Date: Jan 15, 2024
  Package: General
  Expected Lifespan: 18 months (from Settings)
  MRR: $150
  Predicted LTV: $150 × 18 = $2,700
```

### **Aggregate Metrics:**
```
Avg LTV by Source = Average of all LTVs for that source
Avg LTV by Package = Average of all LTVs for that package
Overall Avg LTV = Average of ALL member LTVs
```

---

## 📊 Churn Rate Calculation

### **Auto-Calculated from Actual Data**

As you requested: **Option A**

### **Monthly Churn Rate:**
```
Month: October 2024
Active members Oct 1: 150
Cancellations in Oct: 5
Monthly Churn Rate: 5 ÷ 150 = 3.3%
```

### **Package-Specific Churn:**
```
Active PT members Oct 1: 40
PT cancellations in Oct: 2
PT Churn Rate: 2 ÷ 40 = 5.0%
```

### **Overall Churn:**
```
Total member-months: Sum of all lifespans
Total cancellations: Count of cancelled members
Overall Churn Rate: Cancellations ÷ Member-months
```

## 🎯 How to Use the System

### **One-Time Setup (Your Existing Members)**

1. **Go to Import Members tab**
2. **Fill in your 50-200 existing members**:
   - Row 4: Example member (John Smith) - reference this for format
   - Rows 5+: Add your members
   - Required: Member ID, Name, Join Date, Package, MRR, Status
   - If Cancelled: Add Cancel Date and Reason
3. **Columns K & L auto-calculate** (Lifespan and LTV)
4. **Don't touch this tab again** (it's for historical data only)

### **Ongoing Usage (New Members)**

**New members flow through Lead Data tab as usual:**
1. GHL creates lead → Lead Data tab
2. Lead converts → check "Converted?" box
3. Fill in: Member Start, Membership Type, MRR
4. System automatically includes them in LTV calculations

**Both sources (Import Members + Lead Data) combine for analytics!**

---

## 📈 Dashboard Usage

### **Daily Check-In:**
1. Go to DASHBOARD
2. Scroll to "LIFETIME VALUE (LTV) METRICS" section (row 65)
3. Review:
   - **LTV by Source table**: Which sources bring best long-term value?
   - **LTV:CAC ratios**: Are you profitable? (aim for 3:1 or higher)
   - **Churn Rate**: Losing too many members? (aim for <5%)
   - **Active Members count**: Growing or shrinking?

### **Weekly/Monthly Deep Dive:**
1. Go to **LTV Analysis** tab
2. Check **LTV by Source**: Focus marketing on high-LTV sources
3. Check **LTV by Package**: Which memberships are most valuable?
4. Check **Monthly Churn**: Is churn increasing or decreasing?
5. Check **Cohort Analysis**: Are newer members better than older ones?

## 🔍 Key Metrics Explained

### **LTV (Lifetime Value)**
- **What**: Total revenue you expect from a member over their entire relationship
- **Good**: $2,000+
- **Great**: $3,000+
- **Formula**: MRR × Average Lifespan
- **Why it matters**: Shows true customer value, not just first purchase

### **LTV:CAC Ratio**
- **What**: How much value you get per dollar spent acquiring customers
- **Good**: 3:1 (you make $3 for every $1 spent)
- **Great**: 5:1 or higher
- **Formula**: Avg LTV ÷ CAC
- **Why it matters**: Shows marketing ROI and profitability

### **Churn Rate**
- **What**: Percentage of members who cancel each month
- **Good**: <5% per month
- **Great**: <3% per month
- **Formula**: Cancellations This Month ÷ Active Members Start of Month
- **Why it matters**: High churn = leaky bucket, need to fix retention

### **Retention Rate**
- **What**: Percentage of members who stay active
- **Good**: >80%
- **Great**: >90%
- **Formula**: Active Members ÷ Total Members
- **Why it matters**: Inverse of churn, shows member satisfaction

### **Average Lifespan**
- **What**: How long members stay (in months) on average
- **Good**: 12+ months
- **Great**: 18+ months
- **Formula**: Average of all member lifespans
- **Why it matters**: Longer lifespan = higher LTV

---

## 💡 Insights You Can Now Get

### **1. Which marketing channels bring the most valuable customers?**
**Answer**: LTV Analysis → LTV by Source table
- Not just cheapest leads (low CAC)
- But leads who stay longest and pay most

**Action**: Reallocate budget to high-LTV sources

---

### **2. Is my marketing profitable long-term?**
**Answer**: DASHBOARD → LTV:CAC ratio column
- If <3:1 for a source → losing money or barely profitable
- If >5:1 for a source → very profitable, scale it up

**Action**: Cut sources below 3:1, double down on sources above 5:1

---

### **3. Which membership packages are most valuable?**
**Answer**: LTV Analysis → LTV by Package table
- PT might have highest MRR but lowest lifespan
- General might have lower MRR but highest lifespan

**Action**: Promote packages with highest overall LTV

---

### **4. Why is my churn so high?**
**Answer**: LTV Analysis → LTV by Package + Monthly Churn Rate
- Is one package churning more than others?
- Is churn increasing month-over-month?

**Action**: Interview cancelling members, identify patterns

---

### **5. Are newer members better than older ones?**
**Answer**: LTV Analysis → Cohort Analysis tables
- Compare Jan 2024 cohort LTV vs Oct 2024 cohort LTV
- If newer cohorts have lower LTV → your onboarding got worse
- If newer cohorts have higher LTV → you're improving!

**Action**: Adjust onboarding, trial process, or pricing

---

### **6. What's my gym's true financial health?**
**Answer**: DASHBOARD → Overall Average LTV + Active Members
```
Gym Value = Overall Avg LTV × Active Members
Example: $2,650 LTV × 142 members = $376,300 total gym value
```

**Action**: Track this monthly, aim to grow it

---

## 📋 Example Workflow

### **Scenario: You have 150 existing members**

**Step 1: Import Existing Members** (30 min one-time)
```
Go to Import Members tab
Fill rows 4-153 (your 150 members)
Columns K & L auto-calculate LTV
```

**Step 2: Check Initial Metrics**
```
Go to DASHBOARD
See Overall Average LTV (e.g., $2,450)
See LTV by Source table
Note: Member Referral has highest LTV ($3,200)
```

**Step 3: Make Decision**
```
Insight: Member Referral has $3,200 LTV, no CAC (∞ ratio)
Action: Create referral incentive program
Plan: Offer $100 to members who refer friends
Logic: Even with $100 cost, LTV:CAC = 32:1 (amazing!)
```

**Step 4: Track Results** (Monthly)
```
Go to LTV Analysis → Cohort Analysis
Compare cohorts before/after referral program
See if new members from referrals have similar high LTV
Adjust program based on results
```

---

## 🔧 Customization Options

### **Adjust LTV Assumptions (Settings Tab)**

If you know your gym's historical data:
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Find "LTV ASSUMPTIONS" section (G16)
3. Update Expected Lifespan for each package
4. Churn Rate will auto-calculate

**Example**:
```
You know PT members stay 14 months on average (not 12)
Change PT Expected Lifespan: 12 → 14
Churn Rate updates: 8.3% → 7.1%
All active PT member LTV predictions update
```
