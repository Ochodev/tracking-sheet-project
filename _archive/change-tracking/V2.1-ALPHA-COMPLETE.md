## 🗺️ UTM Attribution System

### Settings Tab - UTM Mapping (G3:H14)

| Raw UTM Source | Standardized Source |
|----------------|---------------------|
| adwords | Paid Search |
| google / cpc | Paid Search |
| google / organic | Organic Search |
| fb_ad | Paid Social |
| instagram | Paid Social |
| facebook | Social Media |
| (direct) | Direct Traffic |
| referral | Referrals |
| gohighlevel | CRM UI |
| member_referral | Member Referral |
| walkin | Walk-In |
| (none) | Others |

**How to Add:**
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Scroll to column G
3. Add row with: Your raw source | Your standardized source
4. Source auto-updates in Lead Data

---

## 📅 Date Range System

### DASHBOARD Dropdown (B2)

**9 Preset Options:**
1. Last 7 Days
2. Last 14 Days
3. **Last 30 Days** (default)
4. Last 90 Days
5. Last 6 Months
6. Last 12 Months
7. Quarter-to-Date
8. Year-to-Date
9. Custom Range

**How It Works:**
- Select preset in DASHBOARD dropdown
- Settings B26-B27 calculate actual start/end dates
- All KPIs filter by those dates
- Charts will use same dates (in beta)

**Custom Range:**
- Select "Custom Range" from dropdown
- Go to Settings tab
- Enter custom dates in B28 (start), B29 (end)
- DASHBOARD updates automatically

## 💰 Monthly Marketing Spend

### Marketing Tab Format

| Month | Source | Location | Monthly Budget | Days in Month | Daily Rate |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 2025-01 | Paid Social | Downtown | $3,000 | 31 (auto) | $96.77 (auto) |

### Generate Daily Spend

**Menu:** Gym Ops → Generate Daily Spend

**What It Does:**
1. Reads all monthly budgets from Marketing tab
2. Calculates days in month, daily rate
3. Generates daily rows (e.g., 31 rows for January)
4. Populates _Daily Spend tab:
   ```
   Date        Source       Location  Daily Spend
   2025-01-01  Paid Social  Downtown  $96.77
   2025-01-02  Paid Social  Downtown  $96.77
   ...
   2025-01-31  Paid Social  Downtown  $96.77
   ```
5. CAC/CPL calculations use _Daily Spend filtered by date range

**Run When:**
- After adding/changing monthly budgets
- Beginning of each month
- Before pulling reports

---

## 🔐 Protections Applied

**Warning-Only Mode:**
- Lead Data: H (Source), P (Trial End), Z (Status)
- _UTM Tracking: O (Standardized Source)
- _Daily Spend: Entire sheet
- Marketing: E (Days), F (Daily Rate)

**What This Means:**
- Can still edit if needed (with warning)
- Prevents accidental formula deletion
- Visual cue (light background on protected columns)
