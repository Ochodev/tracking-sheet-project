## 🚀 Next Steps: Test It!

### Step 1: Create Test Sheet
```bash
1. Go to sheets.google.com
2. Create new blank spreadsheet
3. Name it "Test - Gym Ops v2.0"
```

### Step 2: Add Code
```bash
1. Extensions → Apps Script
2. Copy Code.gs from this repo
3. Paste → Save
4. Copy appsscript.json (optional, for timezone)
```

### Step 3: Run Wizard
```bash
1. Refresh sheet (F5)
2. Wait for "Gym Ops" menu
3. Click: Gym Ops → Quick Start Wizard
4. Authorize when prompted
5. Follow 4-step wizard
6. Done! ✅
```

### Step 4: Verify

**Check tabs created (8):**
- [ ] DASHBOARD
- [ ] Lead Data
- [ ] Members
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Marketing
- [ ] Staff
- [ ] Help
- [ ] _Data (hidden)

**Check Lead Data columns (25):**
- [ ] A-J: Created Date through Location
- [ ] K-M: Appt Set?, Appt Date, Show?
- [ ] N-O: Trial Start, Trial End (auto)
- [ ] P-T: Converted?, Member Start, Type, MRR, Upfront
- [ ] U-W: Cancelled?, Cancel Date, Cancel Reason
- [ ] X-Y: Notes, Current Status (auto)

**Check DASHBOARD sections:**
- [ ] Section 1: KPIs & On-Pace Status
- [ ] Section 2: Action Items
- [ ] Section 3: Member Alerts
- [ ] Section 4: Trends (Active Members chart)

**Test functionality:**
- [ ] Add a test lead (Name, Source, Staff, Location)
- [ ] Check "Appt Set?" → verify Current Status updates
- [ ] Check "Show?" → verify Current Status updates
- [ ] Check "Converted?" → fill MRR → verify appears in Members tab
- [ ] Check DASHBOARD shows metrics

### Step 5: Compare to Goals

From IMPROVEMENTS.md, verify:

1. **Simpler:** Fewer tabs, fewer columns? ✅
2. **Faster:** 2-min setup vs 30-min? ✅
3. **Clearer:** One DASHBOARD vs 3 tabs? ✅
4. **Easier:** Wizard vs manual? ✅
5. **Transparent:** Formulas vs code triggers? ✅
