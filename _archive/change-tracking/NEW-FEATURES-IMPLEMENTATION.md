# üéâ NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Features Implemented:** 3 of 4 requested  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Core features ready for testing

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES**

#### **1. Net Gain/Loss by Membership Type + Dashboard Display**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- **Location:** Dashboard rows 34-40, backed by `_Metrics` hidden tab

**What Was Built:**
- Created `_Metrics` hidden helper sheet that calculates:
  - **Gains**: Members where Member Start (R) falls in date range
  - **Losses**: Members where Cancel Date (W) falls in date range
  - **Net**: Gains minus Losses
  - **% Change**: Growth rate calculation
- Added Dashboard card showing all 4 membership types + "All Types" rollup
- Connected to existing date range controls (B2 dropdown)
- Conditional formatting: Green for positive net, red for negative net

**User Experience:**
1. Change date range dropdown (B2) on Dashboard
2. Net Gain/Loss table updates automatically
3. Visual color coding shows at-a-glance performance
4. Tooltip on title explains what each metric means

**Data Validation:**
- Guards against Cancel Date before Member Start (already existed)
- Ignores invalid data automatically

---

#### **3. Notes System (Simplified)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- **Location:** Lead Data column Y (Notes), column AF (Last Touchpoint)

**What Was Built:**
- Used existing Notes column (Y) - no changes needed
- Added new column AF "Last Touchpoint" (auto-updated timestamp)
- Implemented `onEdit` trigger that updates AF whenever Y is edited
- Made AF visible on Members tab via QUERY update
- Added comprehensive tooltips explaining the system

**User Experience:**
1. Edit Notes (column Y) for any lead/member
2. Last Touchpoint (column AF) automatically updates with timestamp
3. Sort by Last Touchpoint to find members needing follow-up
4. Notes visible on both Lead Data and Members tabs

**Technical Details:**
- Timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- Silent update (no toast notification to avoid interrupting workflow)
- Uses frozen timestamp (not volatile formula)
- Column AF has light blue background (#e8f0fe) to indicate auto-update

---

#### **4. Last Touchpoint Auto-Update**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented  
- **Integrated with:** Feature #3 (Notes System)

**How It Works:**
- `onEdit` trigger detects changes to column Y (Notes)
- Automatically writes formatted timestamp to column AF
- Works for any row in Lead Data tab
- No manual intervention needed

**Code Location:**
- `Code.gs` lines 128-135 (onEdit trigger)

---

### **‚è≥ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**

#### **2. Toggles on Members Sheet**
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete

**What's Already Done:**
- ‚úÖ Membership Type already has data validation (from Settings & Budget)
- ‚úÖ Members tab is already a filtered view (QUERY formula)
- ‚úÖ Status (Current Status in column Z) auto-calculated

**What Still Needs Work:**
- ‚è≥ Named ranges for Membership Type list
- ‚è≥ Named ranges for Status values
- ‚è≥ Filter Views on Members tab for quick filtering
- ‚è≥ Filter controls/slicers

**Recommendation:**
Test features 1, 3, and 4 first. Feature 2 requires additional design decisions about filter UI placement and behavior.

- **Impact:** If you have custom links/references to Dashboard rows, update them
- **Affected:** Member Alerts (42), SOURCE ANALYSIS (55), LTV METRICS (65+), STAFF (92+)

## üí° BEST PRACTICES

### **Using Last Touchpoint:**
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Sort by Last Touchpoint to find cold leads
- Use for follow-up scheduling
- Track engagement frequency
- Filter members by touchpoint recency

‚ùå DON'T:
- Manually edit Last Touchpoint (will be overwritten)
- Delete the column (breaks auto-update)
- Use for historical analysis (only tracks latest)
```

### **Using Net Gain/Loss:**
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Change date range to analyze different periods
- Compare month-over-month trends
- Identify which types are growing/declining
- Use Net for capacity planning

‚ùå DON'T:
- Expect real-time updates (requires date range change)
- Compare across different date ranges without noting the range
- Ignore negative net (address cancellations!)
```

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)

If you want to complete Feature #2 (Toggles), here's what's needed:

### **A. Named Ranges**
```javascript
// Add to createNamedRanges function
ss.setNamedRange('MembershipTypes', settingsSheet.getRange('D14:D17'));
ss.setNamedRange('StatusValues', settingsSheet.getRange('...'));
```

### **B. Filter Views**
```javascript
// Add to Members tab creation
const criteria = SpreadsheetApp.newFilterCriteria()
  .setVisibleValues(['PT', 'General'])
  .build();
sheet.getFilter().setColumnFilterCriteria(19, criteria);
```

### **C. Filter Controls**
- Add dropdown slicers above Members table
- Link to filter criteria
- Requires additional UI design

**Recommendation:** Evaluate if built-in Google Sheets filters are sufficient before building custom solution.

## üìû SUPPORT

If you encounter issues:

   - Check that you're editing column Y (Notes) in Lead Data tab
   - Verify column AF exists and has correct column number (32)
   - Test with a simple one-word note edit

2. **Net Gain/Loss showing zeros?**
   - Verify you have members with Member Start dates in the selected range
   - Check that Member Start (R) and Membership Type (S) have values
   - Try "Last 30 Days" date range to ensure some data is captured

3. **Dashboard section not visible?**
   - Scroll down past Action Items (rows 17-30)
   - Look for row 34
   - If missing, re-run Initialize Template
