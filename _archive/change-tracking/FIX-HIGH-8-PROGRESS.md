# 🔧 HIGH #8: Date Chronology Validation - Implementation Log

## 📋 PRE-IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS

### **Current Understanding:**

**Problem:**
Users can enter dates in illogical order:
- Member Start before Trial Start
- Trial Start before Created Date
- Cancel Date before Member Start
- Appointment Date before Created Date

**Current State:**
- ❌ No validation
- ❌ Illogical dates accepted
- ❌ Breaks funnel metrics
- ❌ Confusing data

**Risk Level:** 🟡 HIGH
- Bad data → bad metrics
- CAC calculations wrong
- Funnel analysis incorrect
- Days to Convert negative or wrong

**Date Fields in Order:**
1. **B - Created Date** (earliest)
2. **M - Appt Date** (after created)
3. **O - Trial Start** (after created/appt)
4. **P - Trial End** (auto-calculated, after trial start)
5. **R - Member Start** (after trial start, close to trial end)
6. **W - Cancel Date** (after member start, latest)

## 🎯 STEP 1: DESIGN VALIDATION LOGIC

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### **Validation Rules:**

**Rule 1: Appointment Date (M) must be ≥ Created Date (B)**
- Can't schedule appointment before lead exists
- Alert: "Appointment date cannot be before lead created date"

**Rule 2: Trial Start (O) must be ≥ Created Date (B)**
- Can't start trial before lead exists
- Alert: "Trial start cannot be before lead created date"

**Rule 3: Trial Start (O) must be ≥ Appt Date (M)** (if appt exists)
- Trial usually starts after appointment
- Alert: "Trial start should not be before appointment date"

**Rule 4: Member Start (R) must be ≥ Trial Start (O)** (if trial exists)
- Can't become member before starting trial
- Alert: "Member start cannot be before trial start"

**Rule 5: Cancel Date (W) must be ≥ Member Start (R)** (if member)
- Can't cancel before becoming member
- Alert: "Cancel date cannot be before member start date"

### **Implementation Strategy:**

**Option A: Formula-Based Validation**
- Add validation columns
- Show errors in sheet
- ❌ Clutters sheet, doesn't prevent entry

**Option B: Data Validation Rules**
- Google Sheets built-in validation
- ❌ Can't compare across columns easily

**Option C: onEdit Trigger Validation**
- Check dates when user edits
- Show alert if invalid
- Clear cell if user wants
- ✅ Clean, prevents bad data

**Choosing:** Option C (onEdit validation)

## 🔨 STEP 2: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Status:** 🔄 READY TO START

### **Function to Create:**

**`validateDateChronology(sheet, row, col, value)`**
- Called from onEdit trigger
- Checks if date is in valid order
- Returns: null (valid) or error message

**Integration:**
- Add to onEdit trigger (after duplicate check)
- Only check date columns (B, M, O, R, W)
- Only check when value is a date

### **Alert Flow:**

```
User enters date → onEdit fires → validateDateChronology()
  → If invalid: Show alert with clear message
  → User choice: Cancel (clear) or Continue (keep anyway)
```

### **Edge Cases:**

✅ Empty dates (skip validation)
✅ Non-date values (skip validation)
✅ Editing existing date (allow if fixing)
✅ Partial data (e.g., no appt date, trial date OK)
