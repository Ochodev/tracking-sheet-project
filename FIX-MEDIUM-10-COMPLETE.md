## 📊 CONTENT BREAKDOWN

### **Workflow 1: UTM Tracking**
```
Purpose: Captures UTM parameters for source attribution

Configuration:
  • Sheet ID location explained
  • Tab name: "_UTM Tracking"
  • Append row method
  
Field Mapping (10 columns):
  A - Lead ID        → {{contact.id}}
  B - Created Date   → {{contact.date_added}}
  C - UTM Source     → {{contact.utm_source}}
  D - UTM Medium     → {{contact.utm_medium}}
  E - UTM Campaign   → {{contact.utm_campaign}}
  F - UTM Term       → {{contact.utm_term}}
  G - UTM Content    → {{contact.utm_content}}
  H - GCLID          → {{contact.gclid}}
  I - FBCLID         → {{contact.fbclid}}
  J - Referrer       → {{contact.referrer_url}}
```

### **Workflow 2: Lead Data**
```
Purpose: Creates lead row with contact details

⚠️ CRITICAL: Add 5-second delay after Workflow 1
(Ensures UTM data exists before Lead Data references it)

Field Mapping (26 columns):
  REQUIRED FIELDS (6):
    A-F: Lead ID, Date, Name, Phone, Email
  
  OPTIONAL FIELDS (5):
    G-K: DOB, Source (auto), Campaign, Staff, Location
  
  FUNNEL FIELDS (14):
    L-Y: Appt, Trial, Conversion, Membership, Cancellation
    (Leave empty - filled by staff)
  
  AUTO-CALCULATED (5):
    Z-AE: Status, Age, Score, Action, Duplicate, Days to Convert
    (Sheet calculates automatically)
```

### **Testing Checklist**
```
8-Step Verification:
  ✅ Create test contact with UTMs
  ✅ Wait 10 seconds
  ✅ Check _UTM Tracking tab
  ✅ Check Lead Data tab
  ✅ Verify Source auto-filled
  ✅ Verify contact details
  ✅ Delete test data
  ✅ Test multiple sources
```

### **Troubleshooting (6 Issues)**
```
1. Source shows "⚠️ Not Tracked"
   → Lead in Lead Data but not _UTM Tracking
   → Check UTM workflow ran successfully

2. Source shows "⚠️ No UTM"
   → Contact has no UTM source
   → Use "CRM UI" or "Direct Traffic"

3. Source shows "⚠️ Unmapped"
   → UTM not in mapping table
   → Add to Settings & Budget (G-H)

4. Duplicate leads created
   → Workflow triggered multiple times
   → Add "Only if contact is new" filter

5. Date fields showing errors
   → Date format mismatch
   → Use YYYY-MM-DD format

6. Workflow not running
   → Connection/permissions issue
   → Re-authenticate Google account
```

## 📊 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### **Before Fix:**
```
User sees minimal GHL instructions (7 rows):
  "1. Create GHL Workflow: Trigger = Contact Created"
  "2. Action: Add Row to "Lead Data" tab"
  "3. Map fields: Lead ID=contact.id, Created Date=date_created, etc."
  "4. Action: Add Row to "_UTM Tracking" tab"
  "5. Map UTM fields: utm_source, utm_campaign, etc."
  "6. Test with dummy contact"
    ↓
User confused:
  • Which action first?
  • What about the 5-second delay?
  • How do I map 26 columns?
  • What if source shows "⚠️ Not Tracked"?
  • What are the GHL variable names?
    ↓
Results:
  • Calls support
  • Manual data entry instead
  • Misconfigured workflow
  • Lost automation benefits
```

### **After Fix:**
```
User sees comprehensive guide (151 rows):
  • Clear 2-workflow sequence
  • 5-second delay highlighted
  • All 26 columns mapped with GHL variables
  • Testing checklist to verify success
  • Troubleshooting for 6 common issues
  • Pro tips for best practices
    ↓
User follows step-by-step:
  ✅ Sets up Workflow 1 (UTM)

  ✅ Sets up Workflow 2 (Lead Data)
  ✅ Maps all fields correctly
  ✅ Tests with dummy contact
  ✅ Verifies source auto-fills
  ✅ Troubleshoots any issues themselves
    ↓
