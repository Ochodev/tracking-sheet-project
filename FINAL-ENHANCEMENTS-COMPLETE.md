## All Requested Features Implemented

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**File:** `GYM-OPS-ULTRA-COMPLETE.gs`  
**Size:** ~1,750 lines  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Task 1: Expanded Quick Test** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Lines 1357-1444

**New Tests Added:**
- ✅ LTV Analysis tab exists
- ✅ _LTV Calculations tab exists  
- ✅ Date range system connected
- ✅ Marketing Budget section exists
- ✅ DASHBOARD date range working
- ✅ Source Analysis exists
- ✅ LTV Analysis wired with QUERY formulas
- ✅ Lead Data dropdowns configured

**Total Tests:** 8 comprehensive checks (was 5)

---

### **✅ Task 2: Marketing Budget Formulas Wired** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Lines 649-651

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** Only row 44 had formulas
- **After:** ARRAYFORMULA applies to rows 44-100

**Formulas:**
- Column D: `=ARRAYFORMULA(IFERROR(IF(A44:A100="","",DAY(EOMONTH(...)))))` - Days in Month
- Column E: `=ARRAYFORMULA(IFERROR(IF(C44:C100="","",C44:C100/D44:D100)))` - Daily Rate

**Benefit:** Add any number of budget entries, formulas auto-calculate!

---

### **✅ Task 3: Last Touchpoint Tracking** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Lines 494-513, 137

**How It Works:**
- When Notes column (AA) is edited
- Last Touchpoint (AH) auto-updates with current date/time
- Tracks most recent interaction
- Useful for follow-up timing

**Handler:** `handleLastTouchpoint(e)` called in `onEdit`

---

### **❌ Task 4: Column Reorganization** (SKIPPED)
**Recommendation:** SKIPPED as planned

**Why:** Moving Notes from AA to H would require updating 50+ formulas across multiple tabs. Current structure works perfectly.

**If needed later:** Can be done, but it's a 2-3 hour project affecting every tab.

---

### **✅ Task 5: Row Color Coding by Stage** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Lines 796-822

**Color Rules:**
| Stage | Condition | Color | Visual Cue |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Appointment Set** | Appt Set=TRUE, Show=FALSE, Converted=FALSE | 🟠 Light Orange | Lead has appointment |
| **Trial Started** | Start Trial=TRUE, Converted=FALSE | 🟡 Light Yellow | Lead is trialing |
| **Converted Member** | Converted=TRUE, Cancelled=FALSE | 🟢 Light Green | Active member |
| **Cancelled** | Cancelled=TRUE | 🔴 Dark Red | Lost customer |

**Benefit:** Visual status at a glance!

---

### **✅ Task 6: LTV Analysis Verified** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Lines 1017-1038

**All QUERY Formulas Verified:**
- ✅ Section 1: `QUERY('_LTV Calculations'!N2:U11...)` - LTV by Source (11 sources)
- ✅ Section 2: `QUERY('_LTV Calculations'!W2:AD6...)` - LTV by Package (4 packages)
- ✅ Section 3: `QUERY('_LTV Calculations'!A15:D27...)` - Monthly Churn (12 months)
- ✅ Section 4: `QUERY('_LTV Calculations'!F15:K27...)` - Cohort Monthly (12 months)
- ✅ Section 5: `QUERY('_LTV Calculations'!M15:R23...)` - Cohort Quarterly (8 quarters)

**Status:** All formulas correct, LTV Analysis fully populated!
